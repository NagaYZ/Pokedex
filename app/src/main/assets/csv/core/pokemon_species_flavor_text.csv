Magmar are feared as one of the causes
behind fires."

volcano. When wounded, it bathes in lava to heal its body, much

either the forelegs or hind legs, it’s proof that Crobat has been
flying a long distance. It switches the wings it uses if it is tired."

make a sound. This Pokémon rests by hanging on a tree

Pokémon. If it can’t drink any blood for even a
short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly."

sound, Crobat flies swiftly toward its prey and
sinks its fangs into the nape of its target’s neck."
169,34,"This Pokémon flaps its four wings skillfully.
Crobat can fly through cramped caves without
needing to slow down."

expertly maneuvers its four wings to dart in exquisite fashion
through even the most confined caves without losing any speed."

humans. However, if it does so, it also
surprises itself."
172,34,"The electric sacs in its cheeks are small. If even a
little electricity leaks, it becomes shocked."

from the front, it is left without recourse when
attacked from behind."
411,28,"It lived in the same environments as Rampardos.
Their fossils have been found together—
seemingly from after they’d fought to the finish."
411,29,"The bones of its face are huge and hard, so
they were mistaken for its spine until after this
Pokémon was successfully restored."
411,30,"This Pokémon is from roughly 100 million years
ago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder
than steel."
411,39,"Its face is sturdy—as strong as diamond—and this hardness
offers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still
unknown, such as its natural habitat."
412,12,"To shelter itself from cold, wintry
winds, it covers itself with a cloak
made of twigs and leaves."
412,13,"If its cloak is broken in battle,
it quickly remakes the cloak with
materials nearby."
412,14,"Even if it is born where there are
no cocooning materials, it somehow
always ends up with a cloak."

412,26,"If its cloak is broken in battle, it quickly remakes
the cloak with materials nearby."
412,39,"If its cloak is even slightly damaged, Burmy will immediately
repair it with whatever is close at hand. The Pokémon within the
cloak is scrawny and vulnerable to the cold."
413,12,"When BURMY evolved, its cloak
became a part of this Pokémon’s
body. The cloak is never shed."
413,13,"Its appearance changes depending
on where it evolved. The materials
on hand become a part of its body."
413,14,"When evolving, its body takes in
surrounding materials. As a result,
there are many body variations."

414,12,"It loves the honey of flowers
and steals honey collected by
COMBEE."
414,13,"It does not keep a nest. It flies
over fields and mountains in
constant search of floral honey."

being observed feeding primarily on the nectar of flowers,
Mothim is not often seen around flower gardens."
415,12,"A Pokémon formed by three others.
It busily carries sweet floral
honey to VESPIQUEN."
415,13,"It collects and delivers honey to
its colony. At night, they cluster
to form a beehive and sleep."
415,14,"The trio is together from birth.

together. Each one has a slightly different taste
in nectar."
415,34,"It ceaselessly gathers nectar from sunrise to
sundown, all for the sake of Vespiquen and
the swarm."
415,39,"They swear fealty to a queen Pokémon and work diligently to
gather nectar. Each swarm produces a different flavor of honey."
416,12,"Its abdomen is a honeycomb for
grubs. It raises its grubs on
honey collected by COMBEE."
416,13,"When endangered, grubs from its
six-cell honeycomb strike back.
There is only one in a colony."
416,14,"It releases various pheromones
to make the grubs in its body do
its bidding while fighting foes."

to defend Vespiquen."
416,34,"Vespiquen that give off more pheromones
have larger swarms of Combee attendants."
416,39,"Commands its subjects to build its hive. It will dispatch any
interlopers who dare sneak into its nest and use them as
nourishment for itself."
417,12,"It makes fur balls that crackle
with static electricity. It stores
them with berries in tree holes."
417,13,"It makes electricity with pouches
in its cheeks and shoots charges
from its tail. It lives atop trees."
417,14,"A pair may be seen rubbing their

electrified tail or cheeks."
418,12,"It has a flotation sac that is
like an inflatable collar. It floats
on water with its head out."
418,13,"It swims by rotating its two tails
like a screw. When it dives, its
flotation sac collapses."

419,39,"Has a long, rather splendid flotation sac, which prevents
Floatzel from drowning even in stormy seas. One might glimpse
this species around fishing hamlets from time to time."
420,12,"The small ball holds the nutrients
needed for evolution. Apparently,
it is very sweet and tasty."
420,13,"Sunlight colors it red. When the
small ball is drained of nutrients,
it shrivels to herald evolution."
420,14,"The small ball is not only filled with

420,33,"It nimbly dashes about to avoid getting pecked
by bird Pokémon that would love to make off
with its small, nutrient-rich storage ball."
420,34,"The deeper a Cherubi’s red, the more nutrients it
has stockpiled in its body. And the sweeter and
tastier its small ball!"
420,39,"Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and
plump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit
then detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures."
421,12,"It blooms during times of strong
sunlight. It tries to make up for
everything it endured as a bud."

petals to absorb the sun’s rays with its whole body."
421,33,"As a bud, it barely moves. It sits still, placidly
waiting for sunlight to appear."
421,34,"Its folded petals are pretty tough. Bird Pokémon
can peck at them all they want, and Cherrim
won’t be bothered at all."

Pokémon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the
scent exuded from Cherrim's folded petals."

the seashore. Its color and form differ according
to its habitat and the quality of its food."
422,28,"Purple mucus sticks to the hands of anyone
who touches it. Take care, as the substance is
troublesome to wash off."
422,29,"While they normally live in the sea, they can
function on land, too, until their skin dries out."
422,30,"When it senses danger, a purple liquid oozes out
of it. The liquid is thought to be something like
greasy sweat."

causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid.
Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky."

Shellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any
person they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!"

bones. If any part of its body is
torn off, it grows right back."
423,13,"It apparently had a huge shell for
protection in ancient times.

food source. It comes onto the land periodically,
but the reason for this is not known."
423,29,"Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There’s now
a vestigial plate on its back that’s hard but thin."
423,30,"Their shape and color change, depending on
their environment and diet. There are many of
them at beaches where the waves are calm."
423,33,"Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land,
where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it
passes through."
423,34,"The softness of its body helps disperse the force
of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly
squishy, it’s also surprisingly resilient."
423,39,"Eats beach sand for nourishment. Should one Gastrodon
encounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will inevitably ensue."
424,12,"To eat, it deftly shucks nuts
with its two tails. It rarely uses
its arms now."
424,13,"They work in large colonies and
make rings by linking their
tails, apparently in friendship."
424,14,"Split into two, the tails are so
adept at handling and doing things,
AMBIPOM rarely uses its hands."

424,29,"In their search for comfortable trees, they get
into territorial disputes with groups of
Passimian. They win about half the time."
424,30,"It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both
of its tails around you and gives you a squeeze,
that’s proof it really likes you."
424,39,"To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring
by linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions,
humans have been accepted into such rings."
425,12,"A Pokémon formed by the spirits
of people and Pokémon. It loves
damp, humid seasons."
425,13,"It tugs on the hands of children
to steal them away. However, it
gets pulled around instead."

Pokémon. When trying to make friends with
children, Drifloon grabs them by the hand."
425,33,"Perhaps seeking company, it approaches children.
However, it often quickly runs away again when
the children play too roughly with it."
425,34,"The gathering of many souls gave rise to this
Pokémon. During humid seasons, they seem to
appear in abundance."
425,39,"Said to lure away young children and carry them off to the
afterlife. Some whisper that Drifloon are formed of reincarnated
human souls, but these rumors are as yet unconfirmed."
426,12,"It’s drowzy in daytime, but flies
off in the evening in big groups.
No one knows where they go."
426,13,"It carries people and Pokémon
when it flies. But since it only
drifts, it can end up anywhere."
426,14,"At dusk, swarms of them are
carried aloft on winds. When
noticed, they suddenly vanish."
426,15,"It can generate and release gas
within its body. That’s how it can
control the altitude of its drift."

426,18,"At dusk, swarms of them are
carried aloft on winds. When

426,21,"They carry people and Pokémon,
but the wind can catch them, so
there can’t be a fixed destination."
426,22,"They carry people and Pokémon,
but the wind can catch them, so

426,23,"It carries people and Pokémon when it flies.

big groups. No one knows where they go."
426,25,"It carries people and Pokémon when it flies.
But since it only drifts, it can end up anywhere."
426,26,"It’s drowsy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in
big groups. No one knows where they go."
426,27,"There was once an incident in which a man
took a trip riding a Drifblim, only to go missing."
426,28,"Even while under careful observation, large
flocks of Drifblim flying at dusk will inexplicably
disappear from view."
426,29,"There’s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim
floating on the wind at dusk, you’ll be carried
away to the afterlife."
426,30,"The raw material for the gas inside its body
is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it’s
thought to carry away people and Pokémon."
426,33,"Some say this Pokémon is a collection of souls
burdened with regrets, silently drifting through
the dusk."
426,34,"It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them
off somewhere. Where do they go?
Nobody knows."
426,39,"It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy
aspect touches some people deeply—every so often, one will
come upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim."
427,12,"It slams foes by sharply uncoiling
its rolled ears. It stings enough
to make a grown-up cry in pain."
427,13,"When it senses danger, it perks up
its ears. On cold nights, it sleeps
with its head tucked into its fur."
427,14,"Its ears are always rolled up. They
can be forcefully extended to
shatter even a large boulder."
427,15,"You can tell how it feels by the way
it rolls its ears. When it’s scared,
both ears are rolled up."
427,16,"You can tell how it feels by the way

427,18,"Its ears are always rolled up. They

and striking the ground, it can
bound so high it surprises itself."

427,26,"When it senses danger, it perks up its ears.
On cold nights, it sleeps with its head tucked into
its fur."
427,29,"Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its
ears up tight and then unleashes them with its
full force, it can smash boulders to dust."
427,30,"The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it
can launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked
by an enemy."
427,33,"If both of Buneary’s ears are rolled up, something
is wrong with its body or mind. It’s a sure sign the
Pokémon is in need of care."
427,34,"Buneary can attack by rolling up their ears and
then striking with the force created by unrolling
them. This attack becomes stronger with training."
427,39,"My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its
hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its
hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears."
428,12,"An extremely cautious Pokémon.
It cloaks its body with its fluffy
ear fur when it senses danger."
428,13,"It is very conscious of its looks
and never fails to groom its ears.
It runs with sprightly jumps."
428,14,"The ears appear to be delicate. If
they are touched roughly, it kicks
with its graceful legs."
428,15,"It sheds its fur twice a year.
Its winter fur is soft and fluffy."

428,26,"The ears appear to be delicate. If they are touched
roughly, it kicks with its graceful legs."
428,29,"Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers
and hats made from its fur are really warm."
428,30,"It’s notably wary and has a dislike of fighting,
but at the same time, it can deliver powerful
kicks with its lithe legs."
428,33,"Lopunny is constantly monitoring its surroundings.
If danger approaches, this Pokémon responds
with superdestructive kicks."
428,34,"Once hot seasons are over, Lopunny’s coat will
be replaced with fur that holds a lot of insulating
air in preparation for colder weather."
428,39,"Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as
though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents
with ease."
429,12,"Its cries sound like incantations.
Those hearing it are tormented
by headaches and hallucinations."
429,13,"It chants incantations. While they
usually torment targets, some
chants bring happiness."
429,14,"Its cry sounds like an incantation.
It is said the cry may rarely be
imbued with happiness-giving power."
429,15,"Its cries sound like incantations
to torment the foe. It appears
where you least expect it."
429,16,"Its cries sound like incantations

429,26,"Its cries sound like incantations to torment the foe.
It appears where you least expect it."
429,27,"It appears as if from nowhere—muttering
incantations, placing curses, and giving
people terrifying visions."
429,28,"Mismagius have been known to cast spells to
make people fall in love, so some people search
for this Pokémon as if their life depended on it."
429,29,"Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads,
this Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells
that help people."
429,30,"Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches
or terrifying visions that torment others."
429,39,"The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune,
so a custom exists of inviting it into one's home. Incur the
Pokémon's displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue."
430,12,"Becoming active at night, it is
known to swarm with numerous
MURKROW in tow."
430,13,"It makes its MURKROW cronies
bring it food. It idles its time
away, grooming itself in its nest."
430,14,"If one utters a deep cry, many
MURKROW gather quickly. For this,
it is called “Summoner of Night.”"
430,15,"It is merciless by nature. It is said
that it never forgives the mistakes
of its MURKROW followers."
430,16,"It is merciless by nature. It is said

430,26,"Becoming active at night, it is known to swarm with
numerous Murkrow in tow."
430,27,"A single cry from this nocturnal Pokémon, and
more than a hundred of its Murkrow cronies
will assemble."
430,28,"If its Murkrow cronies fail to catch food for it,
or if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt
them down wherever they are and punish them."
430,29,"It will absolutely not forgive failure from or
betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this
if it wants to maintain the order of the flock."
430,30,"Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it.
The only time it dirties its own hands is in
delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent."
430,39,"One cry from this Pokémon, and a murder of Murkrow come
flying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had
fallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness."
431,12,"It claws if displeased and purrs
when affectionate. Its fickleness
is very popular among some."
431,13,"With its sharp glare, it puts
foes in a mild hypnotic state.
It is a very fickle Pokémon."
431,14,"It hides its spiteful tendency of
hooking its claws into the nose of
its Trainer if it isn’t fed."
431,15,"When it’s happy, GLAMEOW
demonstrates beautiful movements
of its tail, like a dancing ribbon."

431,39,"Bewitches humans with its helical tail and piercing gaze.
Its hidden claws are quite sharp as well, making this Pokémon
an exceedingly tricky opponent if antagonized."
432,12,"It is a brazen brute that barges
its way into another Pokémon’s
nest and claims it as its own."
432,13,"To make itself appear intimidatingly
beefy, it tightly cinches its waist
with its twin tails."
432,14,"It binds its body with its tails to
make itself look bigger. If it locks
eyes, it will glare ceaselessly."
432,15,"It would claim another Pokémon’s
nest as its own if it finds a nest
sufficiently comfortable."
432,16,"It would claim another Pokémon’s

432,39,"Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great
popularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses
even velveteen."
433,12,"It emits cries by agitating an orb
at the back of its throat.
It moves with flouncing hops."
433,13,"Each time it hops, it makes a
ringing sound. It deafens foes by
emitting high-frequency cries."
433,14,"There is an orb inside its mouth.
When it hops, the orb bounces all
over and makes a ringing sound."
433,15,"It emits high-frequency cries that

433,26,"There is an orb inside its mouth. When it hops,
the orb bounces all over and makes a

433,39,"This Pokémon gave me an excruciating headache when it
seemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are
some sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing."
434,12,"It protects itself by spraying a
noxious fluid from its rear. The
stench lingers for 24 hours."
434,13,"It sprays a nose-curling,
stinky fluid from its rear to
repel attackers."
434,14,"It sprays a foul fluid from its
rear. Its stench spreads over a
mile radius, driving Pokémon away."
434,15,"The foul fluid from its rear is so

434,33,"From its rear, it sprays a foul-smelling liquid at
opponents. It aims for their faces, and it can hit
them from over 16 feet away."
434,34,"If it lifts its tail and points its rear at you, beware.
It’s about to spray you with a fluid stinky enough
to make you faint."
434,39,"The poison that gushes from its aft end is accompanied by an
utterly evil-smelling odor with such potency that one whiff can
induce memory loss."
435,12,"It sprays a vile-smelling fluid
from the tip of its tail to attack.
Its range is over 160 feet."
435,13,"It sprays a stinky fluid from its
tail. The fluid smells worse the
longer it is allowed to fester."

435,26,"It sprays a stinky fluid from its tail. The fluid smells

435,33,"In its belly, it reserves stinky fluid that it shoots
from its tail during battle. As this Pokémon’s diet
varies, so does the stench of its fluid."
435,34,"It digs holes in the ground to make its nest.
The stench of the fluid it lets fly from the tip
of its tail is extremely potent."
435,39,"Sprays a poisonous fluid to take down prey. Sometimes, unable
to stomach the stench of its own fluid, it leaves the bested
prey uneaten."

discovered in ancient tombs. It is
unknown if they are related."

body doesn’t come from any culture in the
Galar region, so it remains shrouded in mystery."
436,34,"Polishing Bronzor to a shine makes its surface
reflect the truth, according to common lore.
Be that as it may, Bronzor hates being polished."
436,39,"Floats using a mysterious energy. The pattern engraved upon its
back is held as sacred and can sometimes be found in imagery
from ancient cemeteries and other such timeworn places."
437,12,"One caused a news sensation when
it was dug up at a construction
site after a 2,000-year sleep."

clouds. When angered, it lets out a warning cry
that rings out like the tolling of a bell."

originated outside the Galar region, based on
the patterns on its body."
437,39,"Some believe that its bell-like cry opens holes to another world.
It has been revered as a deity since ancient times."
438,12,"It looks as if it is always crying.
It is actually adjusting its body’s
fluid levels by eliminating excess."
438,13,"It prefers arid environments. It
leaks water from its eyes to
adjust its body’s fluid levels."
438,14,"It prefers an arid atmosphere. It
leaks water that looks like tears
when adjusting its moisture level."

438,26,"It prefers an arid atmosphere. It leaks water that
looks like tears when adjusting its moisture level."
438,27,"It does not deal well with water, so it lives in dry
locales. Since its surroundings tend to lack
greenery, it stands out noticeably."
438,28,"From its eyes, it can expel excess moisture from
its body. This liquid is similar in composition to
human sweat."
438,29,"It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it
look like it’s crying—apparently an effective way
of getting enemies to let down their guard."
438,30,"If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a
process reminiscent of sweating, its eyes
expel moisture."
438,33,"It expels both sweat and tears from its eyes.
The sweat is a little salty, while the tears have
a slight bitterness."
438,34,"This Pokémon lives in dry, rocky areas. As its
green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases."
438,39,"Its tears elicit sympathy from those who see them, but do
not be deceived! This expulsion of body water is merely a
physiological mechanism for keeping itself in good health."
439,12,"It habitually mimics foes. Once
mimicked, the foe cannot take its
eyes off this Pokémon."
439,13,"It likes places where people
gather. It mimics foes to confuse

467,27,"They dwell in volcanic craters. According to
what is known, a single pair of male and female
Magmortar lives in one volcano."
467,28,"From its arm, it launches fireballs hotter than
3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Its arm starts to
melt when it fires a whole barrage."
467,29,"There are still quite a few factories that rely on
the flames provided by Magmortar to
process metals."
467,30,"Magmortar takes down its enemies by shooting
fireballs, which burn them to a blackened crisp.
It avoids this method when hunting prey."
467,33,"When Magmortar inhales deeply, the fire burning
in its belly intensifies, rising in temperature to
over 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit."
467,34,"Living in the crater of a volcano has caused this
Pokémon’s body to resemble its environment—
it has an organ similar to a magma chamber."

been seen at all."
468,34,"Known as a bringer of blessings, it’s
been depicted on good-luck charms
since ancient times."
468,39,"Scant few have ever sighted this Pokémon. After studying what

the snowfall that Glaceon creates will be frozen
before they know it."
471,34,"The coldness emanating from Glaceon causes
powdery snow to form, making it quite a popular
Pokémon at ski resorts."

As the weather grows colder, its ice tusks
grow longer, thicker, and more impressive."

Pokémon evolve, but even academics can’t agree
on whether Porygon-Z is really an evolution."

get too near. If you do, your nightmares will
become reality."
518,34,"It drowses and dreams all the time. It’s best to
leave it be if it’s just woken up, as it’s a terrible
grump when freshly roused from sleep."
519,17,"Each follows its Trainer’s orders as
best it can, but they sometimes fail to
understand complicated commands."

524,27,"Born deep within the ground, it compares itself
with similar species, such as Geodude and

524,28,"The hexagonal cavity is its ear. It walks in the
direction of sounds it hears, but if the sounds
cease, it panics and topples over."

an energy core, so if you stick your hand in
there, Roggenrola will be very angry!"

rock. The material that makes up its body is
dirt from several hundred years ago."
524,33,"It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in
water will cause it to soften a bit."
524,34,"When it detects a noise, it starts to move.
The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon
slightly warm to the touch."

Just one crystal fragment would provide
enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks."

water. It’s not comfortable around water, so
this Pokémon takes great care in lapping it up."
525,29,"The energy overflowing from its body has
turned into orange crystals that are hard
enough to smash diamonds."
525,30,"Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful
energy. They’re valuable, so Boldore is
sometimes targeted for them."
525,33,"If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be
wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy."
525,34,"It relies on sound in order to monitor what’s in its
vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever
changing the direction it’s facing."

construction sites and in mines, working
alongside people and Copperajah."

a dump truck, they have a limitation—

527,17,"Its habitat is dark forests and caves.
It emits ultrasonic waves from its
nose to learn about its surroundings."

evidence that Woobat live there."

searching for its prey—bug Pokémon."
528,17,"It emits sound waves of various
frequencies from its nose, including
some powerful enough to destroy rocks."

ultrasonic waves emitted by a courting
male experiences a positive mood shift."
528,21,"It shakes its tail vigorously when it
emits ultrasonic waves strong enough
to reduce concrete to rubble."

grows darker as it absorbs its wearer’s sweat."
538,34,"They train in groups of five. Any member that
can’t keep up will discard its belt and leave
the group."
539,17,"The sound of Sawk punching boulders
and trees can be heard all the way from
the mountains where they train."
539,18,"Tying their belts gets them pumped and

angers them."
539,33,"If you see a Sawk training in the mountains in its
single-minded pursuit of strength, it’s best to
quietly pass by."
539,34,"The karate chops of a Sawk that’s trained itself
to the limit can cleave the ocean itself."
540,17,"Leavanny dress it in clothes they made
for it when it hatched. It hides its head
in its hood while it is sleeping."
540,18,"This Pokémon makes clothes for itself.
It chews up leaves and sews them with
sticky thread extruded from its mouth."

foliage because the nutrients they make
from fallen leaves nourish the plant life."
541,18,"It protects itself from the cold
by wrapping up in leaves. It stays on
the move, eating leaves in forests."

543,33,"Venipede and Sizzlipede are similar species,
but when the two meet, a huge fight ensues."
543,34,"Its fangs are highly venomous. If this Pokémon
finds prey it thinks it can eat, it leaps for them
without any thought of how things might turn out."
544,17,"Protected by a hard shell, it spins
its body like a wheel and crashes
furiously into its enemies."
544,18,"It is usually motionless, but when
attacked, it rotates at high speed and

poisonous spikes while it stores up the energy it’ll
need for evolution."
545,17,"With quick movements, it chases down
its foes, attacking relentlessly with
its horns until it prevails."
545,18,"Highly aggressive, it uses the claws
near its neck to dig into its opponents
and poison them."
545,21,"It clasps its prey with the claws
on its neck until it stops moving.
Then it finishes it off with deadly poison."

Centiskorch. At the end of one of these battles,
the victor makes a meal of the loser."
546,17,"When attacked, it escapes by shooting
cotton from its body. The cotton serves
as a decoy to distract the attacker."
546,18,"They go wherever the wind takes them.
On rainy days, their bodies are heavier,
so they take shelter beneath big trees."
546,21,"Perhaps because they feel more at ease
in a group, they stick to others they
find. They end up looking like a cloud."

546,27,"When it finds others of its kind, they all stick
together. When enough of them have collected,
the mass resembles a cumulonimbus cloud."
546,28,"Pillows and beds stuffed with cotton exhaled
by Cottonee are soft and puffy, light and airy—
altogether top quality."
546,29,"To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body.
When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows
moist and heavy, and it can’t move as well."

body to create a diversion. The cotton it loses
grows back in quickly."

and Eldegoss produces exquisite cloth that’s
highly prized by many luxury brands."

homes. After it has turned a room into a cotton-

But if the wind gusts up, it’ll blow the cotton on
this Pokémon’s head clean off."
547,29,"This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes,
where it hides important things and scatters
cotton all over the place."
547,30,"Whimsicott doesn’t live in a fixed location. It
floats around on whirling winds, appearing all
over the place to perform its mischief."
547,33,"It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If
it gets wet, it’ll become too heavy to move and
have no choice but to answer for its mischief."
547,34,"As long as this Pokémon bathes in sunlight, its
cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff
builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it."

soil, the areas where Petilil live are
known to be good for growing plants."

leaves refresh those who eat them."

enough to cause dizziness, they provide relief
from weariness—even more so when boiled."
548,28,"By pruning the leaves on its head with
regularity, this Pokémon can be grown into a
fine plump shape."
548,29,"Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil
them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor
will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly."
548,30,"They prefer clean water and soil. When the
environment they live in turns bad, the whole
bunch will up and move to a new area."
548,33,"Petilil appears around sources of clean water.
Boiling leaves from this Pokémon’s head results in
a liquid that’s sometimes used as a bug repellent."

healthier the Pokémon is. Petilil sometimes makes
its home in a well-tended field or flowerbed."

Dry the leaves in the sun, boil them, and then drink the bitter
decoction for remarkably effective relief from fatigue."

raising it, its flowers are the most beautiful
when they bloom in the wild."
549,28,"As soon as it finds a male to be its partner,
the beautiful flower on its head darkens,
droops, and withers away."
549,29,"The fragrance of its flower differs slightly
depending on the soil where it grew up.
Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind."

beauty. The flower on its head needs constant
care, or it will soon wither and rot."
549,33,"It’s believed that even first-rate gardeners have a
hard time getting the flower on a Lilligant’s head
to bloom."
549,34,"Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers
have a sublime scent, but they’re also
staggeringly expensive."
549,39,"I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life
spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes
from its flower crown heartens those in proximity."
550,17,"Red and blue Basculin get along so
poorly, they’ll start fighting instantly.
These Pokémon are very hostile."
550,18,"Red and blue Basculin usually do not

everything else disappears, except for Corphish

the hook. And there are always more to catch—
many people release them into lakes illicitly."
550,34,"In the past, it often appeared on the dinner
table. The meat of red-striped Basculin is on the
fatty side, and it’s more popular with the youth."
550,39,"Though it differs from other Basculin in several respects,
including demeanor—this one is gentle—I have categorized
it as a regional form given the vast array of shared qualities."
551,17,"They live buried in the sands of the
desert. The sun-warmed sands prevent

swimming. This wise behavior keeps its enemies
from finding it and maintains its temperature."
551,28,"It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down
on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over
it. Its favorite food is Trapinch."
551,29,"Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a
comfortable environment for this Pokémon.
Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts."
551,30,"Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly
eats things that have collapsed in the desert.
It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”"
551,33,"The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun
sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand
and sleeps until sunrise."

A female is often the leader of the group, and
the males will gather food."
552,28,"Thanks to the special membrane covering its
eyes, it can see its surroundings clearly, even in
the middle of the night."
552,29,"Krokorok really hates it when its body gets
cold. On nights when the temperature drops,
it digs deep into the desert sands."
552,30,"It buries some of its prey in the sand to use as
emergency meals when its hunts
are unsuccessful."
552,33,"Krokorok has specialized eyes that enable it to
see in the dark. This ability lets Krokorok hunt in
the dead of night without getting lost."

553,27,"Its unique faculty of sight can detect small prey
more than 30 miles away, even in the midst of
a sandstorm."
553,28,"After clamping down with its powerful jaws,
it twists its body around to rip its prey in half."
553,29,"When it spots prey, even at a distance of over
30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it
were water, then jumps out and chomps them."
553,30,"It conceals itself in sandstorms that Flygon
whip up and waits patiently for prey to appear."
553,33,"This Pokémon is known as the Bully of the Sands.
Krookodile’s mighty jaws can bite through heavy
plates of iron with almost no effort at all."
553,34,"While terribly aggressive, Krookodile also has
the patience to stay hidden under sand for days,
lying in wait for prey."
554,17,"When its internal fire is burning, it
cannot calm down and it runs around.
When the fire diminishes, it falls asleep."

554,26,"When it sleeps, it pulls its limbs into its
body and its internal fire goes down to
1,100 degrees Fahrenheit."
554,33,"It derives its power from fire burning inside
its body. If the fire dwindles, this Pokémon will
immediately fall asleep."
554,34,"This popular symbol of good fortune will never
fall over in its sleep, no matter how it’s pushed
or pulled."
555,17,"Its internal fire burns at 2,500° F,
making enough power that it can
destroy a dump truck with one punch."
555,18,"When weakened in battle, it transforms
into a stone statue. Then it sharpens
its mind and fights on mentally."

temperature of its fire, which can reach 2,500
degrees Fahrenheit."

558,33,"This highly territorial Pokémon prefers dry
climates. It won’t come out of its boulder on
rainy days."
558,34,"Its thick claws are its greatest weapons.
They’re mighty enough to crack
Rhyperior’s carapace."
559,17,"Its skin has a rubbery elasticity, so
it can reduce damage by defensively

559,29,"They move in small groups, walking around lazily.
Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked
with a headbutt."
559,30,"It stretches its saggy skin up to its neck to
protect itself. The saggier their skin, the more
respect they garner."
559,33,"If it locks eyes with you, watch out! Nothing and
no one is safe from the reckless headbutts of this
troublesome Pokémon."
559,34,"It protects itself with its durable skin. It’s thought
that this Pokémon will evolve once its skin has
completely stretched out."

certain territory that it never leaves its whole
life long."
560,33,"As halfhearted as this Pokémon’s kicks may seem,
they pack enough power to shatter Conkeldurr’s
concrete pillars."
560,34,"While mostly known for having the temperament
of an aggressive ruffian, this Pokémon takes very
good care of its family, friends, and territory."
561,17,"They never vary the route they fly,
because their memories of guarding
an ancient city remain steadfast."
561,18,"The guardians of an ancient city, they
use their psychic power to attack
enemies that invade their territory."
561,21,"The guardians of an ancient city, they
always fly the same route while
keeping watch for invaders."

People say it no longer remembers that it was
once human."
563,34,"There are many depictions of Cofagrigus
decorating ancient tombs. They’re symbols
of the wealth that kings of bygone eras had."
564,17,"Restored from a fossil, this Pokémon
can dive to depths beyond half a mile."

lived in the sea but came up onto the land to
search for prey."
564,30,"Its hunting grounds encompassed a broad area,
from the land to more than half a mile deep in
the ocean."
564,33,"This Pokémon inhabited ancient seas. Although
it can only crawl, it still comes up onto land in
search of prey."
564,34,"Tirtouga is considered to be the ancestor of
many turtle Pokémon. It was restored to life
from a fossil."
565,17,"They can live both in the ocean and on
land. A slap from one of them is enough
to open a hole in the bottom of a tanker."
565,18,"Incredible jaw strength enables them
to chew up steel beams and rocks
along with their prey."
565,21,"It could knock out a foe with a slap from

Omastar and Omanyte whole and not be
bothered in the slightest by their shells."
565,30,"Carracosta eats every last bit of the prey it
catches, even the shells and bones, to further
strengthen its sturdy shell."
565,33,"Carracosta completely devours its prey—bones,
shells, and all. Because of this, Carracosta’s own
shell grows thick and sturdy."
565,34,"This Pokémon emerges from the water in search
of prey despite the fact that it moves more
slowly on land."

566,26,"Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, they were
unable to fly and moved about by hopping from one
branch to another."
566,27,"It is the ancestor of all bird Pokémon. Archen
itself could not actually fly but moved by
hopping from treetop to treetop."
566,28,"To all appearances flightless, it was able to
glide down from tall treetops to snag its prey."
566,29,"Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird
Pokémon, some of the latest research suggests
that may not be the case."
566,30,"Restored from a fossil, this ancient bird
Pokémon has wings but can’t yet fly."
566,33,"This Pokémon was successfully restored from a
fossil. As research suggested, Archen is unable
to fly. But it’s very good at jumping."

the prey cornered, another would swoop on it."
567,29,"This ancient Pokémon’s plumage is delicate,
so if anyone other than an experienced
professional tries to restore it, they will fail."
567,30,"Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the
muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak,
so it needs a long runway in order to take off."
567,33,"It needs a running start to take off. If Archeops
wants to fly, it first needs to run nearly 25 mph,
building speed over a course of about 2.5 miles."
567,34,"Though capable of flight, Archeops was
apparently better at hunting on the ground."

They can be spotted in Alola, often with Grimer
in hot pursuit."
568,28,"It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then
it belches toxic gas. An unlucky whiff of gas will
put a person in the hospital."
568,29,"Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes.
Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will
come drooling."
568,30,"If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the
toxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be
a life-threatening situation."
568,33,"Its favorite places are unsanitary ones. If you
leave trash lying around, you could even find
one of these Pokémon living in your room."

trash. Galarian Weezing relish the fumes belched
by Trubbish."

569,27,"Beware the poisonous liquid it shoots from its
right arm. If even a little of it gets on you, you’ll
experience the effects of the unidentified toxin."
569,28,"For a time, their numbers increased explosively
in Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their
population has decreased dramatically."
569,29,"It locks opponents in place with its left hand,
immobilizing them by entirely dousing their
bodies with poisonous liquid."
569,30,"Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a
little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere
is the presence of Muk, their natural enemy."
569,33,"This Pokémon eats trash, which turns into poison
inside its body. The main component of the
poison depends on what sort of trash was eaten."
569,34,"The toxic liquid it launches from its right arm
is so virulent that it can kill a weakened
creature instantly."

570,26,"To protect themselves from danger, they hide their
true identities by transforming into people
and Pokémon."
570,29,"This Pokémon has a cowardly disposition, so
when it’s not around friends, it basically
always stays transformed as something else."
570,30,"If a normally talkative child suddenly stops
talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua."
570,33,"Zorua is a timid Pokémon. This disposition seems
to be what led to the development of Zorua’s
ability to take on the forms of other creatures."
570,34,"Zorua sometimes transforms into a person and
goes into cities to search for food. When Zorua
does this, it usually takes on the form of a child."
570,39,"A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power
from resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes
on the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice."

power to make hundreds of people see
its illusions."
571,30,"If it thinks humans are going to discover its den,
Zoroark shows them visions that make them
wander around in the woods."
571,33,"This Pokémon cares deeply about others of its
kind, and it will conjure terrifying illusions to
keep its den and pack safe."
571,34,"Seeking to ease the burden of their solitude,
lonely Trainers tell Zoroark to show illusions
to them."
571,39,"With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of
death. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses
with a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark's own body."

572,29,"A clean freak that will not allow even the
slightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to
thoroughly clean any and all filth."
572,30,"When its tail has gotten dirty from self-cleaning
or from cleaning its nest, Minccino spends a
whole day washing its tail in clean spring water."
572,33,"The way it brushes away grime with its tail
can be helpful when cleaning. But its focus on
spotlessness can make cleaning more of a hassle."
572,34,"They pet each other with their tails as a form of
greeting. Of the two, the one whose tail is fluffier
is a bit more boastful."
573,17,"Their white fur is coated in a special oil

deflect attacks."

secreted from its body, so this Pokémon can
slide right away from its enemies’ attacks."

smooth. For people troubled by bad skin,
this oil is an effective treatment."
573,33,"Its body secretes oil that this Pokémon spreads
over its nest as a coating to protect it from dust.
Cinccino won’t tolerate even a speck of the stuff."
573,34,"A special oil that seeps through their fur helps
them avoid attacks. The oil fetches a high price
at market."
574,17,"Their ribbonlike feelers increase their
psychic power. They are always staring
at something."
574,18,"They intently observe both Trainers and
Pokémon. Apparently, they are looking
at something that only Gothita can see."

can still be heard making a muted cry. Many believe
it’s speaking to something only it can see."

Pokémon. Tales of Gothorita leading
people astray are told in every corner."
575,18,"Starlight is the source of their power.
At night, they mark star positions by
using psychic power to float stones."
575,21,"According to many old tales, it creates

behind ancient people’s invention of the
first gears."

rotates, it communicates its feelings to
others. When angry, it rotates faster."

perfectly with the outer part of the big gear, and
this Pokémon’s rotation speed increases sharply."
600,34,"Many companies in the Galar region choose
Klang as their logo. This Pokémon is considered
the symbol of industrial technology."
601,17,"Its red core functions as an energy
tank. It fires the charged energy
through its spikes into an area."
601,18,"The gear with the red core is

spin at high speed. Its new spiked gear isn’t
a living creature."
602,17,"While one alone doesn’t have much power,
a chain of many Tynamo can be as
powerful as lightning."
602,18,"These Pokémon move in schools. They
have an electricity-generating organ, so

also how they test each other’s strength."
610,34,"They play with each other by knocking their large
tusks together. Their tusks break sometimes, but
they grow back so quickly that it isn’t a concern."
611,17,"Since a broken tusk will not grow back,
they diligently sharpen their tusks on
river rocks after they’ve been fighting."
611,18,"Their tusks can shatter rocks.

into water vapor. Cryogonal are almost never
seen during summer."

closing the lid of its shell. It can spit
a sticky, poisonous liquid."

electricity. When together with Karrablast,
Shelmet evolves for some reason."

kicks and chops differs from pack to pack."
619,33,"In one minute, a well-trained Mienfoo can chop
with its arms more than 100 times."
619,34,"Though small, Mienfoo’s temperament is fierce.
Any creature that approaches Mienfoo carelessly
will be greeted with a flurry of graceful attacks."

attacks and then slowly stores up power
before delivering the finishing blow."

danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to
see is about to be unleashed!"

sunbathing—it won’t be able to move if its body
gets too cold."

residence in nests dug out by other Pokémon,
treating the stolen nests as their own lairs."

blades allow it to bring down opponents."

the finishing blow to an opponent."

they’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re
kicked out and have to make their own way."
667,30,"This hot-blooded Pokémon is filled with
curiosity. When it gets angry or starts
fighting, its short mane gets hot."
668,23,"The male with the largest mane of fire
is the leader of the pride."
668,24,"With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger.
The females protect the pride’s cubs."
668,25,"The male with the largest mane of fire
is the leader of the pride."
668,26,"With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger.
The females protect the pride’s cubs."
668,29,"The males are usually lazy, but when attacked
by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends
with no regard for its own safety."
668,30,"The temperature of its breath is over 10,000
degrees Fahrenheit, but Pyroar doesn’t use it on
its prey. This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat."
669,23,"It draws out and controls the hidden power
of flowers. The flower Flabébé holds
is most likely part of its body."
669,24,"When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on
that flower its whole life long. It floats in the
wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart."
669,25,"It draws out and controls the hidden power

is most likely part of its body."
669,26,"When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on
that flower its whole life long. It floats in the
wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart."
669,29,"It’s not safe without the power of a flower, but
it will keep traveling around until it finds one
with the color and shape it wants."
669,30,"Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s
collected from its flower. The crown has hidden
healing properties."
670,23,"It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for
flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws
out the hidden power of flowers to battle."
670,24,"When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom,
it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance."
670,25,"It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for
flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws
out the hidden power of flowers to battle."
670,26,"When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom,
it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance."
670,29,"It raises flowers and uses them as weapons.
The more gorgeous the blossom, the more
power it contains."
670,30,"It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its
heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives
anyone who messes up a flower bed."
671,23,"It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory,
and it obtains power from basking in the energy
emitted by flowering plants."
671,24,"In times long past, governors of castles
would invite Florges to create flower gardens
to embellish the castle domains."
671,25,"It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory,
and it obtains power from basking in the energy
emitted by flowering plants."
671,26,"In times long past, governors of castles
would invite Florges to create flower gardens
to embellish the castle domains."
671,29,"It controls the flowers it grows. The petal
blizzards that Florges triggers are overwhelming
in their beauty and power."
671,30,"Its life can span several hundred years. It’s said
to devote its entire life to protecting gardens."
672,23,"Thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live in
harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition."
672,24,"If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t
need to eat, because it can generate
energy from the leaves on its back."
672,25,"Thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live in
harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition."
672,26,"If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t
need to eat, because it can generate
energy from the leaves on its back."
673,23,"It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by
subtle shifts in the grip on its horns.
This empathic sense lets them run as if one being."
673,24,"They inhabit mountainous regions.
The leader of the herd is decided by
a battle of clashing horns."
673,25,"It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by
subtle shifts in the grip on its horns.
This empathic sense lets them run as if one being."
673,26,"They inhabit mountainous regions.
The leader of the herd is decided by
a battle of clashing horns."
674,23,"It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies,
but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating.
Chewing on a leaf is its trademark."
674,24,"It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face,
but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head."
674,25,"It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies,
but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating.
Chewing on a leaf is its trademark."
674,26,"It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face,
but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head."
674,27,"It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro,
which it looks up to as a leader."
674,28,"There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside
from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous,
so it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers."
674,29,"It follows Pangoro around like a henchman.
When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf
gets taken away."
674,30,"It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents.
Be nice and pretend to be scared if you
catch it glaring at you intensely."
674,33,"It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then
imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns
to battle and hunt for prey."
674,34,"Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously,
Pancham’s always giving others a glare.
But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling."
675,23,"Although it possesses a violent temperament,
it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in
its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies."
675,24,"It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like
a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take.
Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole."
675,25,"Although it possesses a violent temperament,
it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in
its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies."
675,26,"It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like
a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take.
Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole."
675,27,"It boasts superb physical strength. Those who
wish to become Pangoro’s Trainer have no
choice but to converse with their fists."
675,28,"From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it
deduces its opponent’s movements. It’s eager to
tussle but kindhearted toward its companions."
675,29,"This rowdy Pokémon boasts great physical
strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its
lively character."
675,30,"Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It
doesn’t say much as it pummels opponents with
enough force to send a dump truck flying."
675,33,"This Pokémon is quick to anger, and it has no
problem using its prodigious strength to get its
way. It lives for duels against Obstagoon."
675,34,"Using its leaf, Pangoro can predict the moves of
its opponents. It strikes with punches that can
turn a dump truck into scrap with just one hit."
676,23,"Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes
it more elegant but also increases the
swiftness of its movements."
676,24,"Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon
were the designated guardians of the king."
676,25,"Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes
it more elegant but also increases the
swiftness of its movements."
676,26,"Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon
were the designated guardians of the king."
676,29,"There was an era when aristocrats would
compete to see who could trim their Furfrou’s
fur into the most exquisite style."
676,30,"Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer,
but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it."
677,23,"The organ that emits its intense psychic power is
sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out."
677,24,"It has enough psychic energy to blast
everything within 300 feet of itself,
but it has no control over its power."
677,25,"The organ that emits its intense psychic power is
sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out."
677,26,"It has enough psychic energy to blast
everything within 300 feet of itself,
but it has no control over its power."
677,33,"Though Espurr’s expression never changes,
behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to
contain its devastating psychic power."
677,34,"There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a
wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be
controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome."
678,23,"When in danger, it raises its ears and
releases enough psychic power to
grind a 10-ton truck into dust."
678,24,"The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears
emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly
covered because that power is too immense."
678,25,"When in danger, it raises its ears and
releases enough psychic power to
grind a 10-ton truck into dust."
678,26,"The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears
emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly
covered because that power is too immense."
678,33,"Revealing the eyelike patterns on the insides of
its ears will unleash its psychic powers. It normally
keeps the patterns hidden, however."
678,34,"The defensive instinct of the males is strong.
It’s when they’re protecting themselves or their
partners that they unleash their full power."
679,23,"Apparently this Pokémon is born when a
departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself
to people and drinks their life force."
679,24,"If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps
a blue cloth around that person’s arm and
drains that person’s life energy completely."
679,25,"Apparently this Pokémon is born when a
departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself
to people and drinks their life force."
679,26,"If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps
a blue cloth around that person’s arm and
drains that person’s life energy completely."
679,33,"Honedge’s soul once belonged to a person who
was killed a long time ago by the sword that
makes up Honedge’s body."
679,34,"The blue eye on the sword’s handguard is the
true body of Honedge. With its old cloth, it
drains people’s lives away."
680,23,"When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords,
which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks
and slash their enemies to ribbons."
680,24,"The complex attack patterns of its two swords
are unstoppable, even for an opponent
greatly accomplished at swordplay."
680,25,"When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords,
which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks
and slash their enemies to ribbons."
680,26,"The complex attack patterns of its two swords
are unstoppable, even for an opponent
greatly accomplished at swordplay."
680,33,"Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades
rub together to emit a metallic sound that
unnerves opponents."
680,34,"The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly
alternating between offense and defense to
bring down their prey."
681,23,"Generations of kings were attended by these
Pokémon, which used their spectral power to
manipulate and control people and Pokémon."
681,24,"Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities
of leadership. According to legend, whoever it
recognizes is destined to become king."
681,25,"Generations of kings were attended by these
Pokémon, which used their spectral power to
manipulate and control people and Pokémon."
681,26,"Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities
of leadership. According to legend, whoever it
recognizes is destined to become king."
681,33,"In this defensive stance, Aegislash uses its steel
body and a force field of spectral power to
reduce the damage of any attack."
681,34,"Its potent spectral powers allow it to manipulate
others. It once used its powers to force people
and Pokémon to build a kingdom to its liking."
682,23,"It emits a scent that enraptures those
who smell it. This fragrance changes
depending on what it has eaten."
682,24,"In the past, rather than using perfume,
royal ladies carried a Spritzee
that would waft a fragrance they liked."
682,25,"It emits a scent that enraptures those
who smell it. This fragrance changes
depending on what it has eaten."
682,26,"In the past, rather than using perfume,
royal ladies carried a Spritzee
that would waft a fragrance they liked."
682,33,"A scent pouch within this Pokémon’s body allows
it to create various scents. A change in its diet
will alter the fragrance it produces."
682,34,"The scent its body gives off enraptures those
who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of
love for Spritzee."
683,23,"It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant,
and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order
to gain an edge in battle."
683,24,"Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer
happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will
have a hard time walking alongside it."
683,25,"It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant,
and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order
to gain an edge in battle."
683,26,"Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer
happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will
have a hard time walking alongside it."
683,33,"The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so
powerful that this Pokémon’s companions will
eventually lose their sense of smell."
683,34,"The scents Aromatisse can produce range from
sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells
that sap an opponent’s will to fight."
684,23,"To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes
white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy."
684,24,"Because it eats nothing but sweets,
its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
684,25,"To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes
white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy."
684,26,"Because it eats nothing but sweets,
its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
684,33,"It eats its own weight in sugar every day.
If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes
incredibly grumpy."
684,34,"The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes
Swirlix’s fluffy fur. This Pokémon spits out
sticky string to tangle up its enemies."
685,23,"It can distinguish the faintest of scents.
It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use
by helping pastry chefs in their work."
685,24,"Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than
a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about
everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
685,25,"It can distinguish the faintest of scents.
It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use
by helping pastry chefs in their work."
685,26,"Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than
a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about
everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
685,33,"By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their
mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that
this skill will have many medical applications."
685,34,"Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft
to the touch and lighter than it looks."
686,23,"Opponents who stare at the flashing of the
light-emitting spots on its body become
dazed and lose their will to fight."
686,24,"It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body,
which drains its opponent’s will to fight.
It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide."
686,25,"Opponents who stare at the flashing of the
light-emitting spots on its body become
dazed and lose their will to fight."
686,26,"It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body,
which drains its opponent’s will to fight.
It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide."
686,29,"It draws prey near with its blinking lights and
then wraps them up in its long tentacles and
holds them in place."
686,30,"When exchanging information with others of its
kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its
body in a complex rhythm."
686,33,"It spins while making its luminescent spots flash.
These spots allow it to communicate with others
by using different patterns of light."
686,34,"By exposing foes to the blinking of its
luminescent spots, Inkay demoralizes them,
and then it seizes the chance to flee."
687,23,"It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers
of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do
whatever it wants."
687,24,"It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions,
then wraps its tentacles around it before
finishing it off with digestive fluids."
687,25,"It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers
of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do
whatever it wants."
687,26,"It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions,
then wraps its tentacles around it before
finishing it off with digestive fluids."
687,29,"When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an
endless number of people who utilize Malamar
for their nefarious deeds."
687,30,"It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its
prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are
supremely sharp."
687,33,"Gazing at its luminescent spots will quickly
induce a hypnotic state, putting the observer
under Malamar’s control."
687,34,"It’s said that Malamar’s hypnotic powers played
a role in certain history-changing events."
688,23,"Two Binacle live together on one rock.
When they fight, one of them will move
to a different rock."
688,24,"They stretch and then contract, yanking their
rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat
seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
688,25,"Two Binacle live together on one rock.
When they fight, one of them will move
to a different rock."
688,26,"They stretch and then contract, yanking their
rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat
seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
688,33,"After two Binacle find a suitably sized rock, they
adhere themselves to it and live together.
They cooperate to gather food during high tide."
688,34,"If the two don’t work well together, both their
offense and defense fall apart. Without good
teamwork, they won’t survive."
689,23,"When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven.
They fight with the power of seven Binacle."
689,24,"Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds
of their own, and they will move independently.
But they usually follow the head’s orders."
689,25,"When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven.
They fight with the power of seven Binacle."
689,26,"Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds
of their own, and they will move independently.
But they usually follow the head’s orders."
689,33,"Seven Binacle come together to form one
Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head
gives orders to those serving as the limbs."
689,34,"Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep
watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start
to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat."
690,23,"Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray
liquid poison on prey that approaches
unawares and then finish it off."
690,24,"It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes
while storing up power for its evolution."
690,25,"Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray
liquid poison on prey that approaches
unawares and then finish it off."
690,26,"It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes
while storing up power for its evolution."
690,29,"It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly
still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon.
Rotten seaweed is its main food source."
690,30,"It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the
seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found
near Dhelmise."
690,33,"It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating
seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on
the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead."
690,34,"Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it
can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean
and avoid being detected by enemies."
691,23,"Their poison is strong enough to eat through
the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately
at anything that enters their territory."
691,24,"Tales are told of ships that wander into
seas where Dragalge live, never to return."
691,25,"Their poison is strong enough to eat through
the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately
at anything that enters their territory."
691,26,"Tales are told of ships that wander into
seas where Dragalge live, never to return."
691,29,"This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid
on opponents that come near. For whatever
reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise."
691,30,"It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey
and then takes them down with a poisonous
liquid strong enough to melt metal."
691,33,"Dragalge uses a poisonous liquid capable of
corroding metal to send tankers that enter its
territory to the bottom of the sea."
691,34,"Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking
the plume on its head out above the ocean’s
surface and bathing it in sunlight."
692,23,"They knock down flying prey by firing
compressed water from their massive
claws like shooting a pistol."
692,24,"Through controlled explosions of internal gas,
it can expel water like a pistol shot.
At close distances, it can shatter rock."
692,25,"They knock down flying prey by firing
compressed water from their massive
claws like shooting a pistol."
692,26,"Through controlled explosions of internal gas,
it can expel water like a pistol shot.
At close distances, it can shatter rock."
692,29,"Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low
profile until they grow back. The meat of its
claws is so delicious!"
692,30,"It moves around by jetting water from its right
pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s
terrible at swimming straight."
692,33,"Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but
they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is
popular as a delicacy in Galar."
692,34,"By detonating gas that accumulates in its right
claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet.
This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies."
693,23,"Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of
water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls."
693,24,"By expelling water from the nozzle in the back
of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
693,25,"Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of
water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls."
693,26,"By expelling water from the nozzle in the back
of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
693,29,"It compresses the water it has sucked up and
then projects it with enough power to punch a
hole right through a thick sheet of iron."
693,30,"Its right arm is packed with meat. When its
pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a
cooking ingredient."
693,33,"After using the feelers on its oversized claw to
detect the location of prey, Clawitzer launches
a cannonball of water at its target."
693,34,"Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches
projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a
Clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker."
694,23,"They make their home in deserts. They can
generate their energy from basking in the sun,
so eating food is not a requirement."
694,24,"The frills on either side of its head have cells
that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
694,25,"They make their home in deserts. They can
generate their energy from basking in the sun,
so eating food is not a requirement."
694,26,"The frills on either side of its head have cells
that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
694,33,"When spread, the frills on its head act like solar
panels, generating the power behind this
Pokémon’s electric moves."
694,34,"The sun powers this Pokémon’s electricity
generation. Interruption of that process
stresses Helioptile to the point of weakness."
695,23,"They flare their frills and generate energy.
A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient
electricity to power a skyscraper."
695,24,"It stimulates its muscles with electricity,
boosting the strength in its legs and enabling
it to run 100 yards in five seconds."
695,25,"They flare their frills and generate energy.
A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient
electricity to power a skyscraper."
695,26,"It stimulates its muscles with electricity,
boosting the strength in its legs and enabling
it to run 100 yards in five seconds."
695,33,"A now-vanished desert culture treasured these
Pokémon. Appropriately, when Heliolisk came to
the Galar region, treasure came with them."
695,34,"One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill
outspread is all it would take to produce enough
electricity to power a city."
696,23,"This Pokémon was restored from a fossil.
If something happens that it doesn’t like,
it throws a tantrum and runs wild."
696,24,"Its immense jaws have enough destructive
force that it can chew up an automobile.
It lived 100 million years ago."
696,25,"This Pokémon was restored from a fossil.
If something happens that it doesn’t like,
it throws a tantrum and runs wild."
696,26,"Its immense jaws have enough destructive
force that it can chew up an automobile.
It lived 100 million years ago."
696,29,"Its large jaw has incredible destructive power.
Some theories suggest that its restored form is
different from its form of long ago."
696,30,"Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be
trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s
trying to frolic with are gravely injured."
696,33,"This is an ancient Pokémon, revived in modern
times. It has a violent disposition, and it’ll tear
apart anything it gets between its hefty jaws."
696,34,"This Pokémon is selfish and likes to be pampered.
It can also inflict grievous wounds on its Trainer
just by playing around."
697,23,"Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred
thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was
invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited."
697,24,"Nothing could stop this Pokémon
100 million years ago,
so it behaved like a king."
697,25,"Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred
thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was
invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited."
697,26,"Nothing could stop this Pokémon
100 million years ago,
so it behaved like a king."
697,29,"Complete restoration is impossible, allowing
room for theories that its entire body was
once covered in a feather-like coat."
697,30,"The king of the ancient world, it can easily
crunch a car with the devastating strength
of its enormous jaws."
697,33,"This Pokémon is from about 100,000,000
years ago. It has the presence of a king, vicious
but magnificent."
697,34,"A single bite of Tyrantrum’s massive jaws will
demolish a car. This Pokémon was the king of the
ancient world."
698,23,"This ancient Pokémon was restored
from part of its body that had been
frozen in ice for over 100 million years."
698,24,"This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where
there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum."
698,25,"This ancient Pokémon was restored
from part of its body that had been
frozen in ice for over 100 million years."
698,26,"This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where
there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum."
698,29,"It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said
that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in

later, it pounces."

charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times
larger than itself."

Trainer’s arm because this touch enables it to
read its Trainer’s feelings."
700,33,"By releasing enmity-erasing waves from its
ribbonlike feelers, Sylveon stops any conflict."
700,34,"There’s a Galarian fairy tale that describes
a beautiful Sylveon vanquishing a dreadful
dragon Pokémon."

advantage of its opponents’ blind spots. It’s
also skilled at using superb submission holds."
701,33,"It drives its opponents to exhaustion with its agile
maneuvers, then ends the fight with a flashy
finishing move."
701,34,"It always strikes a pose before going for its
finishing move. Sometimes opponents take
advantage of that time to counterattack."
702,23,"Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and
receiving electrical waves, it can communicate
with others over vast distances."
702,24,"It uses its tail to absorb electricity from
power plants or from outlets in houses,

power plants or from outlets in houses,

electricity from their outlets. When your electric
bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal."
702,30,"Its upper whiskers are sensors that survey its
surroundings. Its lower whiskers are organs
that shoot electricity."
702,33,"A Dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves
other Dedenne send out. These Pokémon share
locations of food or electricity with one another."
702,34,"Since Dedenne can’t generate much electricity on
its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other
electric Pokémon."
703,23,"Born from the temperatures and pressures
deep underground, it fires beams from the
stone in its head."

world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in
a kingdom of jewels."

tarnish, packs of Carbink use their soft manes
to polish one another’s jewels."

out by firing high-energy beams from the gems
embedded in its body."
703,34,"It’s said that somewhere in the world, there’s
a mineral vein housing a large pack of slumbering
Carbink. It’s also said that this pack has a queen."

any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly."
704,27,"The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon,
it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out,
so it sticks to shady places."
704,28,"Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden
mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it
needs some thorough hand-washing."
704,29,"It uses its horns to check out its surroundings.
They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it
will feel a strong shock and be unable to move."
704,30,"Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will
die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness
in the shade."
704,33,"Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if
the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered
the weakest dragon Pokémon."
704,34,"Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as
Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into
hiding. This is how they’ve survived."
704,39,"Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it's nice and
humid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pokémon
instantly becomes lethargic."
705,23,"It drives away opponents by excreting a
sticky liquid that can dissolve anything.
Its eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything."
705,24,"Its four horns are a high-performance radar system.

they’re nicely dissolved, it slurps them up."

on its back is filled with its brain and
other organs."
705,30,"Its entire body is covered with gooey mucus
that can dissolve anything. Be sure to put
gloves on if you’re going to touch it."
705,33,"Although this Pokémon isn’t very strong, its body
is coated in a caustic slime that can melt through
anything, so predators steer clear of it."
705,34,"The lump on its back contains its tiny brain.
It thinks only of food and escaping its enemies."
705,39,"A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell
developed as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with
the iron in Hisui's water."
706,23,"This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon
will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving
that Trainer covered in sticky slime."

706,27,"An amazingly friendly Pokémon, but if left to
itself, loneliness overcomes it, and it oozes
gooey tears."
706,28,"It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then,
whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of
its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail."
706,29,"It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow
close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky,
slime-covered body. Don’t get mad."
706,30,"Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat,
and the combination of the two makes enemies’
attacks slide right off."
706,33,"Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and
appears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers
don’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable."
706,34,"Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its
horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any
blow from a heavyweight boxer."
706,39,"Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell.
It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and
run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side."
707,23,"These key collectors threaten any attackers
by fiercely jingling their keys at them."
707,24,"It never lets go of a key that it likes,

so people give it the keys to vaults and
safes as a way to prevent crime."
707,27,"This even-tempered Pokémon has a habit of
collecting keys. It will sneak into people’s homes
to steal their keys."
707,28,"It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing
metal ions. For some reason, it collects keys."
707,29,"Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving
it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it
apparently only likes master keys."
707,30,"Long ago it lived in mines, but once the minerals
that make up its diet became scarcer, Klefki
began appearing in human settlements."
707,33,"This Pokémon is constantly collecting keys.
Entrust a Klefki with important keys, and the
Pokémon will protect them no matter what."
707,34,"Klefki sucks in metal ions with the horn topping
its head. It seems this Pokémon loves keys so
much that its head needed to look like one, too."
708,23,"These Pokémon are created when
spirits possess rotten tree stumps.
They prefer to live in abandoned forests."
708,24,"According to old tales, these Pokémon are

children who died while lost in the forest."

people to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest.

stump, creating this Pokémon. A cure-all can be
made from an infusion of its green leaves."

spirit possessed a tree stump, causing the spirit’s
rebirth as this Pokémon."

it controls the trees in the forest.
It’s kind to the Pokémon that reside in its body."
709,27,"This Pokémon is said to devour anyone daring to
ravage the forest. To the creatures dwelling in
the forest, it offers great kindness."
709,28,"Through its roots, it exerts control over other
trees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting
down trees in forests where Trevenant dwell."
709,29,"It’s feared as a ghost of the forest.
Lumberjacks bring along Fire types, which
Trevenant hates, when they enter the forest."
709,30,"This Pokémon controls trees via roots
stretching from its feet, and it will attack
anyone that dares to ravage the forest."
709,33,"People fear it due to a belief that it devours any
who try to cut down trees in its forest, but to the
Pokémon it shares its woods with, it’s kind."
709,34,"Small roots that extend from the tips of this
Pokémon’s feet can tie into the trees of the
forest and give Trevenant control over them."
710,23,"The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit
trapped in this world. As the sun sets,
it becomes restless and active."
710,24,"It is said to carry wandering spirits
to the place where they belong
so they can move on."
710,25,"The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit
trapped in this world. As the sun sets,
it becomes restless and active."
710,26,"It is said to carry wandering spirits
to the place where they belong
so they can move on."
710,33,"Spirits that wander this world are placed into
Pumpkaboo’s body. They’re then moved on to
the afterlife."
710,34,"The light that streams out from the holes in the
pumpkin can hypnotize and control the people
and Pokémon that see it."

Anyone who hears their song is cursed."

night. The sounds are said to be the wails of
spirits who are suffering in the afterlife."
711,34,"In the darkness of a new-moon night, Gourgeist
will come knocking. Whoever answers the door
will be swept off to the afterlife."
712,23,"It blocks opponents’ attacks with the
ice that shields its body. It uses cold air
to repair any cracks with new ice."
712,24,"Using air of -150 degrees Fahrenheit, they
freeze opponents solid. They live in herds
above the snow line on mountains."

712,34,"This Pokémon lives in areas of frigid cold.
It secures itself to the back of an Avalugg
by freezing its feet in place."
712,39,"Lives on mountains blanketed in perennial snow. It freezes water
vapor in the air to make the ice helmet that it dons for defense."
713,23,"Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel.
Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that
stands in its way."
713,24,"The way several Bergmite huddle
on its back makes it look like
an aircraft carrier made of ice."

carefully picks out just the ripe ones using

714,30,"It flies around in search of fruit to eat. It uses
ultrasonic waves to detect which fruits are ripe."

nest in during the day. Using their ultrasonic
waves, they go on the hunt for ripened fruit."
714,34,"No wavelength of sound is beyond Noibat’s
ability to produce. The ultrasonic waves it
generates can overcome much larger Pokémon."
715,23,"They fly around on moonless nights
and attack careless prey. Nothing can
beat them in a battle in the dark."

active at night."

they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with
vicious kicks."
722,29,"It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as
blades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong,
so its kicks are also formidable."
722,30,"It feels relaxed in tight, dark places and has
been known to use its Trainer’s pocket or bag
as a nest."
722,33,"At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while
flying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet
switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks."
722,34,"During the day, it builds up energy via
photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently
through the sky, on the prowl for prey."
722,39,"Flies noiselessly on delicate wings. It has mastered the art of
deftly launching dagger-sharp feathers from those same wings."

preening its wings. Its preoccupation with any

it can detect opponents standing behind it,
flinging its sharp feathers to take them out."
723,33,"It throws one knifelike feather after another at its
enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak
point. These feathers are known as blade quills."
723,34,"It never slacks when it comes to the task of
cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it
looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp."
723,39,"Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power—presumably due to
the frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set
into its wings are keen as ever."
724,27,"It fires arrow quills from its wings with such
precision, they can pierce a pebble at distances
over a hundred yards."
724,28,"Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s
caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic."
724,29,"It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at
opponents. When it simply can’t afford to miss,
it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus."
724,30,"Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an
enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are
decided in the blink of an eye."

hidden among the feathers of its wings.
Decidueye’s shots never miss."
724,34,"In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an
arrow quill, piercing an opponent’s weak point
before they notice what’s happening."
724,39,"The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye's feathers
insulates the Pokémon against Hisui's extreme cold. This is
firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment."
725,27,"While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its
stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery
attacks, which change based on how it coughs."
725,28,"It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen.
Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude."
725,29,"If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t
open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving
it too much affection is still a no-no."
725,30,"Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time
comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and
burns away the old fur."
725,33,"It spends even the smallest amount of downtime
grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers
in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves."
725,34,"Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will
result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws.
Be careful."
726,27,"At its throat, it bears a bell of fire. The bell rings
brightly whenever this Pokémon spits fire."
726,28,"It boasts powerful front legs. With a single
punch, it can bend an iron bar right over."
726,29,"It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer.
A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave
its Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches."
726,30,"When its mane is standing on end, you can tell
it’s feeling good. When it isn’t feeling well, its fur
will lie down flat."
726,33,"In the midst of battle, the fire pouch on
Torracat’s neck rings like a bell and produces
stronger flames than usual."
726,34,"When facing a powerful enemy, Torracat’s
fighting spirit gets pumped up, and its fire bell
blazes hotter."
727,27,"This Pokémon has a violent, selfish disposition.
If it’s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its
Trainer’s orders with complete nonchalance."
727,28,"After hurling ferocious punches and flinging
furious kicks, it finishes opponents off by
spewing fire from around its navel."
727,29,"Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it
finds beating down unworthy opponents boring.
It gets motivated for stronger opponents."
727,30,"When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames
around its waist become especially intense."
727,33,"It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles.
The temperature of the flames that issue from its
navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit."
727,34,"Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its
most notable trait, but the way it helps out small
Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well."
728,27,"This Pokémon snorts body fluids from its nose,
blowing balloons to smash into its foes.
It’s famous for being a hard worker."
728,28,"This Pokémon can control water bubbles. It
practices diligently so it can learn to make
big bubbles."
728,29,"The balloons it inflates with its nose grow
larger and larger as it practices day by day."
728,30,"Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons
to jump higher. It’s quite the acrobatic fighter!"
728,33,"It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its
opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer
force of their bursting is what deals damage."
728,34,"If Popplio want to create big, powerful balloons,
they must be persistent. It takes daily practice for
these Pokémon to develop their skills."
729,27,"A skillful dancer, it creates a sequence of water
balloons as it dances, and briskly bombards
its enemies."
729,28,"It cares deeply for its companions. When its
Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery
dance to try and help."
729,29,"It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t
know. This hard worker practices diligently until
it can learn that dance."
729,30,"It attacks by smacking its enemies with the
exploding water balloons that it creates."
729,33,"As if dancing, it artfully dodges the attacks of its
enemies. All the while, it’s busy forming a bunch
of balloons to overwhelm its foes."
729,34,"On nights when the sea is calm, Brionne dance
with one another to the singing of the Primarina
that’s leading them."
730,27,"It controls its water balloons with song. The
melody is learned from others of its kind and is
passed down from one generation to the next."
730,28,"Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle.
This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily
maintenance of its throat at all costs."
730,29,"To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes
down its prey with beautiful singing
and dancing."
730,30,"Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical
look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony
in song."
730,33,"With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound
like beautiful singing. It uses the sonic waves to
control its water balloons."
730,34,"For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing
and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize
the audience."
731,27,"It can peck at a rate of 16 times a second to
drill holes in trees. It uses the holes for food
storage and for nesting."
731,28,"This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover
seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it
fires off from its mouth."
731,29,"It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can
get some idea of its mood or condition from the
rhythm of its pecking."
731,30,"It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are
heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times
per second!"
732,27,"It eats berries and stores their seeds in its
beak. When it encounters enemies or prey,
it fires off all the seeds in a burst."
732,28,"By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of
calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for
its neighbors."
732,29,"It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over
a hundred different cries at will."
732,30,"From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries
it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise
to new plants."
733,27,"When it battles, its beak heats up. The
temperature can easily exceed 212 degrees
Fahrenheit, causing severe burns when it hits."
733,28,"Within its beak, its internal gas ignites,
explosively launching seeds with enough power
to pulverize boulders."
733,29,"They smack beaks with others of their kind to
communicate. The strength and number of hits
tell each other how they feel."
733,30,"Known for forming harmonious couples, this
Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a
good luck charm."
734,27,"With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything.
It did not originally live in Alola but was
imported from another region."
734,28,"It wanders around in a never-ending search for
food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and
falls asleep on the spot."
734,29,"Its stomach takes up most of its long torso.
It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to
spend on its food is no laughing matter."
734,30,"Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh
living things, so it marches down streets
in search of prey."
735,27,"When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently
stakes out the location...but it’s always snoozing
by nightfall."
735,28,"It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner,
but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them.
This Pokémon boasts incredible patience."
735,29,"Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this
Pokémon was brought over a long time ago
when there was a huge Rattata outbreak."
735,30,"Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of
itself and pounces when it spots its favorite
meal—Rattata!"
736,27,"Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and
slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground."
736,28,"They often gather near places frequented by
electric Pokémon in order to avoid being
attacked by bird Pokémon."
736,29,"If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your
hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an
irritated Grubbin."
736,30,"It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in
their tracks, and then it grabs them in its
sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
736,33,"Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may
flee rather than risk getting caught in its large
mandibles that can snap thick tree branches."
736,34,"It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest
floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
737,27,"Its body is capable of storing electricity. On
camping trips, people are grateful to have
one around."
737,28,"From the food it digests, it generates electricity,
and it stores this energy in its electric sac."
737,29,"It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely
moves, munching away on humus. If you
accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!"
737,30,"Its stout shell provides excellent defense from
attacks. It uses electricity on
persistent opponents."
737,33,"While its durable shell protects it from attacks,
Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of
electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws."
737,34,"Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats
into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores
the electricity for later use."
738,27,"It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening.
It concentrates electrical energy within its large
jaws and uses it to zap its enemies."
738,28,"It produces electricity via an electrical organ in
its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with
shocking beams of electrical energy."
738,29,"It has an organ that generates electricity in its
abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong
jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity."
738,30,"Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic
flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for
it to deliver an electric beam attack."
738,33,"It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it
through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off
in concentrated beams."
738,34,"If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery,
a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered
beams of electricity."
739,27,"While guarding its weak points with its pincers,
it looks for an opening and unleashes punches.
When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints."
739,28,"It punches so much, its pincers often come off
from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What
little meat they contain is rich and delicious."
739,29,"Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense
and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler
are like boxing matches."
739,30,"Crabrawler has been known to mistake
Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The
enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it."
740,27,"It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up
on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure
the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur."
740,28,"It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times
of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers
and fire them like rockets."
740,29,"It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its
foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice
to bits!"
740,30,"Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling.
There are records of its turning back
avalanches with a flurry of punches."
741,27,"It beats its wings together to create fire.
As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance,
it bathes opponents in intense flames."
741,28,"This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its
passionate dance moves cause its enemies
to combust in both body and mind."
741,29,"It wins the hearts of its enemies with its
passionate dancing and then uses the opening
it creates to burn them up with blazing flames."
741,30,"This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer
gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon
becomes fiercely angry."
742,27,"It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers.
Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify
which flowers are about to bloom."
742,28,"Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of
people who have auras resembling those
of flowers."
742,29,"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields
of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with
Butterfree over food."
742,30,"Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It
skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’
movements and make fools of them."
742,33,"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can
find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying
to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen."
742,34,"An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that
opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can
glide around the attack and strike back."
743,27,"It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many
different varieties, some used as food and
others used in battle."
743,28,"Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly
nutritious. They are sometimes sold
as supplements."
743,29,"Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates
rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a
hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still."
743,30,"It can predict the weather from moisture levels
and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself
when there are a few clear days in a row."
743,33,"It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar.
The puffs’ effects depend on the type of
ingredients and how much of each one is used."
743,34,"Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or
rained on. In the cloudy Galar region,
they are very seldom seen."
744,27,"It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for
beginners because of its friendliness, but its
disposition grows rougher as it grows up."
744,28,"This Pokémon has lived with people since times
long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the
dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side."
744,29,"As they develop, their disposition grows more
violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them
too much to handle and abandon them."
744,30,"When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you,
that’s proof of its love for you. However, the
rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!"
744,33,"This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its
Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising
a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging."
744,34,"This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking
the ground with the rocks on its neck. The
moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks."
745,27,"Its quick movements confuse its enemies.
Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses
the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons."
745,28,"When properly raised from a young age, it will
become a trustworthy partner that will
absolutely never betray its Trainer."
745,29,"The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives.
Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees
before finishing them off."
745,30,"The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife.
Fragments that break off are treasured as
good luck charms."
745,33,"This Lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks
jutting from its mane are razor sharp."
745,34,"With swift movements, this Pokémon gradually
backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are
always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots."
746,27,"When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin
to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades,
and they stand together against their enemies."
746,28,"It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone
is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone
trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."
746,29,"They’re weak, so they move in schools.
However, they can also often be seen all alone,
having strayed from the school."
746,30,"When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract
others of its kind. The light from its eyes is
visible almost 25 miles away."
746,33,"Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by
gathering up into schools that they’re able
to confront opponents."
746,34,"When it senses danger, its eyes tear up.
The sparkle of its tears signals other
Wishiwashi to gather."
747,27,"It plunges the poison spike on its head into its
prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie
deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles."
747,28,"It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors.
The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as
good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon."
747,29,"They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are
hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola
branches that have naturally fallen off."
747,30,"Aside from its head, its body parts
regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a
good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."
747,33,"The first symptom of its sting is numbness.
The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s
impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin."
747,34,"Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie
of the Galar region have not yet figured out
that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
748,27,"Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its
12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits
scattered in its wake."
748,28,"Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer
intense pain for three days and three nights.
Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects."
748,29,"To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes
flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get
mown down by the claws on its feet."
748,30,"With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter
within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect
Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."
748,33,"To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this
Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing
its body so it can capture its own body heat."
748,34,"Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so
toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still
be suffering three days after it first takes effect."
749,27,"The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances
its grip and its powerful running gait."
749,28,"It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition.
Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire
all form part of its daily routine."
749,29,"It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered
with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed
out and stops listening to its Trainer."
749,30,"Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be
loaded with 50 times its own body weight
and will be totally fine."
749,33,"Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its
own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon.
It’s skilled at making use of mud."
749,34,"It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all
over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk
on rough terrain without slipping."
750,27,"It spits a mud that provides resistance to both
wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were
often coated with it."
750,28,"Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best
means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks
to scrap without breaking a sweat."
750,29,"It remains calm and unmoving no matter the
situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its
mouth to make a special kind of mud."
750,30,"It can trudge mountain roads without rest
for three days and three nights, all the while
dragging a 10-ton load."
750,33,"Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs
sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows
this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick."
750,34,"Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry
over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest
or sleep."
751,27,"It crawls onto the land in search of food.
Its water bubble allows it to breathe and
protects its soft head."
751,28,"When it comes across enemies or potential prey,
this Pokémon smashes its
water-bubble-covered head into them."
751,29,"When two Dewpider meet, they display their
water bubbles to each other. Then the one with
the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
751,30,"It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in
water, so it wears a water bubble on its head
when it walks around on land."
751,33,"It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body
and then covers its head with it. Meeting another
Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes."
751,34,"Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it
comes onto land in search of food, it takes
water with it in the form of a bubble on its head."
752,27,"It delivers headbutts with the water bubble
on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into
the bubble, where they drown."
752,28,"Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares
for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon,
it protectively brings them into its water bubble."
752,29,"It usually passes its time in the water. When its
belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the
water bubble on its head."
752,30,"It has a habit of storing things it values in its
water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out,
Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!"
752,33,"It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning
prey within the bubbles. This Pokémon can then
take its time to savor its meal."
752,34,"It acts as a caretaker for Dewpider, putting them
inside its bubble and letting them eat any
leftover food."
753,27,"During the day, it sleeps and soaks up light.
When night falls, it walks around looking
for a safer place to sleep."
753,28,"They give off a sweet and refreshing scent.
Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where
Fomantis are hiding."
753,29,"When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four
leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its
head has a pleasant aroma."
753,30,"It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the
sunlight regularly, it grows up with
vivid coloration."
753,33,"When bathed in sunlight, this Pokémon emits a
pleasantly sweet scent, which causes bug
Pokémon to gather around it."
753,34,"During the day, Fomantis basks in sunlight and
sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around
at night."
754,27,"It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis’s
vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this
work and treat it as their hobby."
754,28,"It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals.
These beams are powerful enough to cleave
through thick metal plates."
754,29,"For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug
Pokémon. Both of its arms bear
keen-edged petals."
754,30,"As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s
dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some
to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon."
754,33,"This Pokémon resembles a beautiful flower.
A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous,
brilliant colors."
754,34,"The petals on this Pokémon’s arms are thin and
super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if
Lurantis gathers light first."
755,27,"It scatters spores that flicker and glow. Anyone
seeing these lights falls into a deep slumber."
755,28,"As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself
by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall
of night, wandering off in search of a new tree."
755,29,"It scatters its shining spores around itself.
Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours
of forests where Morelull live are popular."
755,30,"It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the
spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow."
755,33,"Pokémon living in the forest eat the
delicious caps on Morelull’s head.
The caps regrow overnight."
755,34,"Morelull live in forests that stay dark even
during the day. They scatter flickering spores
that put enemies to sleep."
756,27,"Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to
enter at night. People confused by its strange
lights can never find their way home again."
756,28,"It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness.
When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon
feeds on them by sucking in their energy."
756,29,"It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their
vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its
kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality."
756,30,"When it starts fighting for territory with
Parasect, the entire area gets completely
coated in spores!"
756,33,"Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to
sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing,
it drains their vitality with its fingertips."
756,34,"If you see a light deep in a forest at night,
don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall
fast asleep."
757,27,"It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous
gas. When its enemies become disoriented from
inhaling the gas, it attacks them."
757,28,"Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home.
It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas
that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them."
757,29,"The males will do whatever the females tell
them. They give the females most of their food.
Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve."
757,30,"It weakens opponents and sends them
reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t
deal well with Spinda, since it’s always reeling."
757,33,"Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this
Pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail.
This process creates Salandit’s poisonous gas."
757,34,"This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey
and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the
prey even realizes Salandit is there."
758,27,"For some reason, only females have been found.
It creates a reverse harem of male Salandit that
it lives with."
758,28,"Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can
be diluted to use in the production of
luscious perfumes."
758,29,"Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the
Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones
to serve it."
758,30,"It punishes Salandit that couldn’t bring it food
with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm."
758,33,"Only female Salazzle exist. They emit a gas laden
with pheromones to captivate male Salandit."
758,34,"The winner of competitions between Salazzle
is decided by which one has the most male
Salandit with it."
759,27,"Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets
angry and flails about, its arms and legs could
knock a pro wrestler sprawling."
759,28,"A touch from anyone except a known friend
sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly
dangerous Pokémon."
759,29,"It boasts power enough to split large trees in
half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that
it uses to communicate with others of its kind."
759,30,"Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any
way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with
amazing power."
759,33,"Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly
reaching out to touch this Pokémon could result
in painful retaliation."
759,34,"The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may
be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is
flailing that can snap thick tree trunks."
760,27,"This immensely dangerous Pokémon
possesses overwhelming physical strength.
Its habitat is generally off-limits."
760,28,"This Pokémon has the habit of hugging its
companions. Many Trainers have left this world
after their spines were squashed by its hug."
760,29,"It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and
warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t
run away as fast as possible."
760,30,"It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many
people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in
the Alola region."
760,33,"Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show
its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is
dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones."
760,34,"The moves it uses to take down its prey would
make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued
prey under its arms to carry them to its nest."
761,27,"A delectable aroma pours from its body.
They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon
lured by that wafting deliciousness."
761,28,"Although it’s too sugary for human consumption,
Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a
juice with just the right amount of sweetness."
761,29,"Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird
Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not
intelligent enough to care."
761,30,"It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird
Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head.
It’s usually a fruitless attempt."
761,33,"Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is
extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon."
761,34,"When under attack, it secretes a sweet
and delicious sweat. The scent only calls
more enemies to it."
762,27,"The sepals on its head developed to protect its
body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked
by bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine."
762,28,"This Pokémon is always bouncing around
energetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by
its lively appearance and pleasant aroma."
762,29,"It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays
with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it
relentlessly, but it doesn’t care."
762,30,"It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its
head with abandon. They’re quite painful when
they smack you!"
762,33,"As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads
out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will
feel a surge of happiness."
762,34,"Any Corvisquire that pecks at this
Pokémon will be greeted with a smack from
its sepals followed by a sharp kick."
763,27,"Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to
be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off
by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously."
763,28,"A Pokémon known for the beauty of its
well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a
mascot in advertisements for beauty salons."
763,29,"A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can
knock out even kickboxing champions with a
single blow."
763,30,"A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and
a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it
kicks an opponent."
763,33,"This feared Pokémon has long, slender legs and
a cruel heart. It shows no mercy as it stomps on
its opponents."
763,34,"A kick from the hardened tips of this Pokémon’s
legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and
soul that will never heal."
764,27,"It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine.
This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off
an aromatic scent."
764,28,"Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine
have a relaxing effect, so this Pokémon
is a hit with many people."
764,29,"It stretches sticky vines out from its head and
picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it
doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy."
764,30,"It picks flowers and sticks them to its body
with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts
from its petals has a healing effect."
764,33,"Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates
itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t
wither once they’re attached to a Comfey."
764,34,"These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear
different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has
its own individual scent."
765,27,"Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon
will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s
best suited to veteran Trainers."
765,28,"Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this
Pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up
at the beach to match wits with Slowking."
765,29,"It normally spends its time meditating in the
treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other
Pokémon orders as it pleases."
765,30,"Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so
they’re always engaging in battles of wits to
decide which one is superior."
765,33,"With waves of its fan—made from leaves and its
own fur—Oranguru skillfully gives instructions to
other Pokémon."
765,34,"It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes
across a wounded Pokémon, Oranguru will
gather medicinal herbs to treat it."
766,27,"They form groups of roughly 20 individuals.
Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never
let down a comrade."
766,28,"They battle with hard berries for weapons.
Their techniques are passed from the boss to
the group, generation upon generation."
766,29,"They use their saliva to stick leaves to their
shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong
to from the position of the leaves."
766,30,"Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of
its diet. The one that can throw a berry the
farthest is the boss of the troop."
766,33,"Displaying amazing teamwork, they follow the
orders of their boss as they all help out in the
search for their favorite berries."
766,34,"Passimian live in groups of about 20, with
each member performing an assigned role.
Through cooperation, the group survives."
767,27,"This Pokémon is a coward. As it desperately
dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a
sparkling clean path in its wake."
767,28,"Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds.
A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down
on anything edible, no matter how rotten."
767,29,"It will pick up anything it finds on the ground.
Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and
Meowth will go after it."
767,30,"An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod
will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if
anything comes near it."
767,33,"It’s nature’s cleaner—it eats anything and
everything, including garbage and rotten things.
The ground near its nest is always clean."
767,34,"Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the
lookout for danger. They scatter the moment
they detect an enemy’s presence."
768,27,"With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws,
it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two."
768,28,"It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends
most of its time peacefully meditating in caves
deep beneath the sea."
768,29,"The shell covering its body is as hard as
diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it
takes to win."
768,30,"Its claws, which it can extend and retract at
will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is
sometimes accompanied by Wimpod."
768,33,"It will do anything to win, taking advantage of
every opening and finishing opponents off with
the small claws on its front legs."
768,34,"They live in sunken ships or in holes in the
seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct
battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal."
769,27,"Born from a sand mound playfully built by a
child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of
the departed."
769,28,"It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its
mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of
its sand-mound body."
769,29,"It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast
will get serious and fight any children who come
to take it back."
769,30,"If you build sand mounds when you’re playing,
destroy them before you go home, or they
may get possessed and become Sandygast."
769,33,"Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of
sand and become a Pokémon. Sandygast is fond
of the shovel on its head."
769,34,"Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes
control of anyone who puts their hand into its
mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger."
770,27,"Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon
transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it
evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger."
770,28,"Buried beneath the castle are masses of
dried-up bones from those whose vitality
it has drained."
770,29,"Each of its grains of sand has its own will.
Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons
away their vital essence while they’re still alive."
770,30,"Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt
its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying
Pokémon snatches away their vitality."
770,33,"Palossand is known as the Beach Nightmare. It
pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling
the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls."
770,34,"This Pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates
water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like
shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain."
771,27,"It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a
beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it
uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies."
771,28,"These Pokémon line the beaches. The sticky
mucous that covers their bodies can be used to
soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!"
771,29,"The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking
started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku
back into the sea after they wash onshore."
771,30,"Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you
accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will
get mad and smack you!"
771,33,"It lives in warm, shallow waters. If it encounters a
foe, it will spit out its internal organs as a means
to punch them."
771,34,"It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist,
allowing it to stay on land for days without
drying up."
772,27,"The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its
intrinsic capabilities. This Pokémon has some
hidden special power."
772,28,"Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon
may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask
to restrain its power."
772,29,"A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific
mission, it went berserk during an experiment,
so it was cryogenically frozen."
772,30,"There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its
true power is sealed away beneath its
control mask."
772,33,"Rumor has it that the theft of top-secret research
notes led to a new instance of this Pokémon
being created in the Galar region."
772,34,"It was modeled after a mighty Pokémon of myth.
The mask placed upon it limits its power in order
to keep it under control."
773,27,"Its trust in its partner is what awakens it.
This Pokémon is capable of changing its type,
a flexibility that is well displayed in battle."
773,28,"Although its name was Type: Null at first, the
boy who evolved it into this form gave it the
name by which it is now known."
773,29,"This is its form once it has awakened and
evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is
greatly increased."
773,30,"Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its
will was strengthened, and it was able to
destroy its control mask."
773,33,"A solid bond of trust between this Pokémon and
its Trainer awakened the strength hidden within
Silvally. It can change its type at will."
773,34,"The final factor needed to release this
Pokémon’s true power was a strong bond
with a Trainer it trusts."
774,27,"Originally making its home in the ozone layer,
it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing
its body grows too heavy."
774,28,"Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This
Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles."
774,29,"It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes
food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run
away, it falls to the ground."
774,30,"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable,
the shock of falling to the ground smashes the
shell to smithereens."
775,27,"It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its
movements are apparently no more than the
results of it tossing and turning in its dreams."
775,28,"The log it holds was given to it by its parents at
birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm
of a friendly Trainer."
775,29,"It stays asleep from the moment it’s born.
When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops
moving altogether."
775,30,"It remains asleep from birth to death as a result
of the sedative properties of the leaves that
form its diet."
776,27,"The shell on its back is chemically unstable
and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its
stomach is its weak point."
776,28,"It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its
nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and
can be put to various uses."
776,29,"It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other
minerals. Materials from the food it eats form
the basis of its explosive shell."
776,30,"Its exploding shell poses a real danger but
is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days,
Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves."
776,33,"Explosive substances coat the shell on its back.
Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away
by an immense detonation."
776,34,"Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes
explosive compounds to develop in its shell.
Its droppings are also dangerously explosive."
777,27,"The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest.
When this Pokémon becomes agitated, its fur
stands on end and stabs into its attackers."
777,28,"The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods.
The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as
energy in its electric sac."
777,29,"When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur
spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily."
777,30,"Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat
limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning
strike it!"
777,33,"With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon
takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon.
It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac."
777,34,"When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes
its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges
electricity indiscriminately."
778,27,"Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar
who saw what was under its rag was
overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock."
778,28,"A lonely Pokémon, it conceals its terrifying
appearance beneath an old rag so it can get
closer to people and other Pokémon."
778,29,"Although it’s a quiet, lonely Pokémon, if you try
to look at what’s under its rag, it will become
agitated and resist violently."
778,30,"A gust of wind revealed what hides under this
Pokémon’s rag to a passing Trainer, who went
home and died painfully that very night."
778,33,"It wears a rag fashioned into a Pikachu costume
in an effort to look less scary. Unfortunately,
the costume only makes it creepier."
778,34,"There was a scientist who peeked under
Mimikyu’s old rag in the name of research.
The scientist died of a mysterious disease."
779,27,"When it unleashes its psychic power from the
protuberance on its head, the grating sound
of grinding teeth echoes through the area."
779,28,"It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then
grinds them to mush with its strong teeth.
Even Shellder’s shell is no match for it."
779,29,"It burrows beneath the sand, radiating
psychic power from the protuberance on its
head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area."
779,30,"Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s
spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches
up the spikes and eats them."
780,27,"It has a compassionate personality, but if it is
angered, it completely destroys its surroundings
with its intense breath."
780,28,"This Pokémon is friendly to people and loves
children most of all. It comes from deep in the
mountains to play with children it likes in town."
780,29,"If a child it has made friends with is bullied,
Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to
the ground."
780,30,"It appears in towns and plays with the children.
Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger,
so their moms don’t have to worry."
780,33,"The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles
in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play
with the children living in the towns below."
780,34,"Drampa is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until
it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a
gale and flattens everything around."
781,27,"Swinging its massive anchor, it can KO Wailord
in a single blow. What appears to be green
seaweed is actually its body."
781,28,"The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became
reborn as this Pokémon. It maintains itself with
new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed."
781,29,"It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks
away their vitality. It only likes to go after big
prey like Wailord."
781,30,"Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch
outward for hundreds of yards. For some
reason, it gets along well with Skrelp."
781,33,"After a piece of seaweed merged with debris
from a sunken ship, it was reborn as this
ghost Pokémon."
781,34,"After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It
catches large Wailord and drains their life-force."
782,27,"It expresses its feelings by smacking
its scales. Metallic sounds echo through
the tall mountains where Jangmo-o lives."
782,28,"They live in mountains where no trace of
humans can be detected. Jangmo-o grow
little by little as they battle one another."
782,29,"It smacks the scales on its head against rocks
or against the ground to frighten its opponents.
It can also contact its friends with these noises."
782,30,"It will never show an enemy its back in battle.
Ancient warriors liked Jangmo-o for its valiant
disposition and made it one of their own."
782,33,"They learn to fight by smashing their head scales
together. The dueling strengthens both their skills
and their spirits."
782,34,"Jangmo-o strikes its scales to communicate with
others of its kind. Its scales are actually fur that’s
become as hard as metal."
783,27,"It leaps at its prey with a courageous shout.
Its scaly punches tear its opponents to shreds."
783,28,"It sheds and regrows its scales on a continuous
basis. The scales become harder and sharper
each time they’re regrown."
783,29,"It makes noise by clanging its scales together.
When the rhythm has reached its peak,
Hakamo-o attacks."
783,30,"The scales it sheds can be molded and
processed to make pots and pans. They
conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item."
783,33,"The scaleless, scarred parts of its body are
signs of its strength. It shows them off to
defeated opponents."
783,34,"Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its
scales together and roars. Its sharp claws
shred the opposition."
784,27,"When it spots enemies, it threatens them by
jingling the scales on its tail. Weak opponents
will crack and flee in panic."
784,28,"Its rigid scales function as offense and defense.
In the past, its scales were processed and used
to make weapons and other commodities."
784,29,"When it howls after finishing off its prey, the
metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can
be heard from all around."
784,30,"It battles valiantly with its fists, which are
armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes
in uppercuts."
784,33,"It clatters its tail scales to unnerve opponents.
This Pokémon will battle only those who stand
steadfast in the face of this display."
784,34,"Certain ruins have paintings of ancient warriors
wearing armor made of Kommo-o scales."
785,27,"This guardian deity of Melemele is brimming with
curiosity. It summons thunderclouds and stores
their lightning inside its body."
785,28,"It confuses its enemies by flying too quickly for
the eye to follow. It has a hair-trigger temper
but forgets what made it angry an instant later."
785,29,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, if a person
or Pokémon puts it in a bad mood, it will become
a malevolent deity and attack."
785,30,"The lightning-wielding guardian deity of
Melemele, Tapu Koko is brimming with curiosity
and appears before people from time to time."
786,27,"This guardian deity of Akala is guilelessly cruel.
The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of
its energy."
786,28,"As it flutters about, it scatters its strangely
glowing scales. Touching them is said to restore
good health on the spot."
786,29,"It heals the wounds of people and Pokémon by
sprinkling them with its sparkling scales. This
guardian deity is worshiped on Akala."
786,30,"Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is
devoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and
can be described as nature incarnate."
787,27,"It pulls large trees up by the roots and swings
them around. It causes vegetation to grow,
and then it absorbs energy from the growth."
787,28,"The guardian deity of Ula’ula is a lazy Pokémon.
It commands plants to immobilize its foes and
then deals them a savage blow with its horns."
787,29,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, it’s violent
enough to crush anyone it sees as an enemy."
787,30,"It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others
know where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts.
This guardian deity of Ula’ula controls plants."
788,27,"The dense fog it creates brings the downfall
and destruction of its confused enemies.
Ocean currents are the source of its energy."
788,28,"The guardian deity of Poni, it can control water.
People say it can create pure water that will
wash away any uncleanness."
788,29,"This guardian deity of Poni Island manipulates
water. Because it lives deep within a thick fog,
it came to be both feared and revered."
788,30,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, terrible
calamities sometimes befall those who
recklessly approach Tapu Fini."
789,27,"Its body is gaseous and frail. It slowly grows as
it collects dust from the atmosphere."
789,28,"In ages past, it was called the child of the stars.
It’s said to be a Pokémon from another world,
but no specific details are known."
789,29,"Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be
blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn’t
seem to care."
789,30,"Whether or not it’s a Pokémon from this world
is a mystery. When it’s in a jam, it warps away
to a safe place to hide."
789,33,"This Pokémon came from another universe.
Its gaseous body is so light that even a gentle
breeze can blow it away."
789,34,"Cosmog is very curious but not very cautious,
often placing itself in danger. If things start to
look dicey, it teleports away."
790,27,"Motionless as if dead, its body is faintly warm to
the touch. In the distant past, it was called the
cocoon of the stars."
790,28,"There’s something accumulating around the
black core within its hard shell. People think
this Pokémon may come from another world."
790,29,"The king who ruled Alola in times of antiquity
called it the “cocoon of the stars” and built
an altar to worship it."
790,30,"As it absorbs light, Cosmoem continues to grow.
Its golden shell is surprisingly solid."
790,33,"The absorption of starlight fuels this Pokémon’s
growth. The shell that encases it is harder than
any known material."
790,34,"It sucks in dust from the air at an astounding rate,
frantically building up energy within its core as
preparation for evolution."
791,27,"It is said to live in another world. The intense
light it radiates from the surface of its body can
make the darkest of nights light up like midday."
791,28,"This Pokémon is said to be a male evolution of
Cosmog. At the activation of its third eye, it
departs for another world."
791,29,"Sometimes the result of its opening an Ultra
Wormhole is that energy and life-forms from
other worlds are called here to this world."
791,30,"In writings from the distant past, it’s called by
the name “the beast that devours the sun.”"
791,33,"When light radiates from its body, this Pokémon
could almost appear to be the sun. It will dispel
any darkness and light up the world."
791,34,"Solgaleo was once known as the Beast That
Devours the Sun. Energy in the form of light
radiates boundlessly from it."
792,27,"It is said to be a female evolution of Cosmog.
When its third eye activates, away it flies to
another world."
792,28,"Said to live in another world, this Pokémon
devours light, drawing the moonless dark veil of
night over the brightness of day."
792,29,"Records of it exist in writings from long, long
ago, where it was known by the name
“the beast that calls the moon.”"
792,30,"It sometimes summons unknown powers and
life-forms here to this world from holes that
lead to other worlds."
792,33,"Known as the Beast That Calls the Moon, this
Pokémon lives by taking in any and all light and
converting it into its own energy."
792,34,"It steals the light from its surroundings and then
becomes the full moon, showering its own light
across the night sky."
793,27,"One of several mysterious Ultra Beasts. People
on the street report observing those infested
by it suddenly becoming violent."
793,28,"One of the Ultra Beasts. It’s unclear whether or
not this Pokémon is sentient, but sometimes it
can be observed behaving like a young girl."
793,29,"A life-form from another world, it was dubbed
a UB and is thought to produce a
strong neurotoxin."
793,30,"It appeared in this world from an Ultra
Wormhole. Nihilego appears to be a parasite
that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon."
794,27,"This Ultra Beast appeared from another world.
It shows off its body, but whether that display
is a boast or a threat remains unclear."
794,28,"A mysterious life-form called an Ultra Beast.
Witnesses saw it pulverize a dump truck with a
single punch."
794,29,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
794,30,"Buzzwole goes around showing off its
abnormally swollen muscles. It is one kind
of Ultra Beast."
795,27,"One of the dangerous Ultra Beasts, it has been
spotted running across the land at
terrific speeds."
795,28,"One of the Ultra Beasts. It refuses to touch
anything, perhaps because it senses some
uncleanness in this world."
795,29,"A life-form that lives in another world, its body
is thin and supple, but it also possesses
great power."
795,30,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
796,27,"One of the mysterious life-forms known as Ultra
Beasts. Astonishing electric shocks emanate
from its entire body, according to witnesses."
796,28,"It appeared from the Ultra Wormhole. It raided a
power plant, so people think it energizes itself
with electricity."
796,29,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
796,30,"They’ve been dubbed Ultra Beasts. Some of
them stand unmoving, like trees, with their
arms and legs stuck into the ground."
797,27,"It appeared from the Ultra Wormhole. Witnesses
observed it flying across the sky at high speed."
797,28,"One kind of Ultra Beast. Witnesses have seen it
burn down a forest by expelling gas from its
two arms."
797,29,"One of the dangerous UBs, high energy readings
can be detected coming from both of its
huge arms."
797,30,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
798,27,"This Ultra Beast came from the Ultra Wormhole.
It seems not to attack enemies on its own, but
its sharp body is a dangerous weapon in itself."
798,28,"One of the Ultra Beast life-forms, it was
observed cutting down a gigantic steel tower
with one stroke of its blade."
798,29,"This Ultra Beast’s body, which is as thin as
paper, is like a sharpened sword."
798,30,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
799,27,"It has gobbled mountains and swallowed whole
buildings, according to reports. It’s one of the
Ultra Beasts."
799,28,"A dangerous Ultra Beast, it appears to be eating
constantly, but for some reason its droppings
have never been found."
799,29,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
799,30,"An unknown life-form called a UB. It may be
constantly hungry—it is certainly always
devouring something."
800,27,"Reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts, this life-form,
apparently asleep underground, is thought to
have come from another world in ancient times."
800,28,"Light is apparently the source of its energy.
It has an extraordinarily vicious disposition
and is constantly firing off laser beams."
800,29,"It looks somehow pained as it rages around in
search of light, which serves as its energy.
It’s apparently from another world."
800,30,"Light is the source of its energy. If it isn’t
devouring light, impurities build up in it and on it,
and Necrozma darkens and stops moving."
800,33,"It survives by absorbing light. After a long time
spent slumbering underground, impurities
accumulated within it, causing its body to darken."
800,34,"It needs light to survive, and it goes on a
rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will
cut anything to pieces."
801,27,"This artificial Pokémon, constructed more than
500 years ago, can understand human speech
but cannot itself speak."
801,28,"Its mechanized body is merely a vessel. Its true
self is its Soul-Heart, an artificial soul."
801,29,"It synchronizes its consciousness with others
to understand their feelings. This faculty makes
it useful for taking care of people."
801,30,"Built roughly 500 years ago by a scientist,
the part called the Soul-Heart is the
actual life-form."
802,27,"Able to conceal itself in shadows, it never
appears before humans, so its very existence
was the stuff of myth."
802,28,"It lurks in the shadows of others, copying their
movements and powers. This Pokémon is craven
and cowering."
802,29,"It slips into the shadows of others and mimics
their powers and movements. As it improves, it
becomes stronger than those it’s imitating."
802,30,"It sinks into the shadows of people and
Pokémon, where it can understand their feelings
and copy their capabilities."
802,33,"By slipping into the shadow of a martial arts
master and copying their movements, this
Pokémon learned the ultimate techniques."
802,34,"This Pokémon can conceal itself in any shadow,
so it went undiscovered for a long time."
803,29,"This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be
chosen as a first partner in its own world."
803,30,"An Ultra Beast that lives in a different world, it
cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with
poison from the needles on its head."
804,29,"It stores hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid
inside its body. It is one of the organisms known
as UBs."
804,30,"One kind of Ultra Beast, it fires a glowing,
venomous liquid from its needles. This liquid
is also immensely adhesive."
805,29,"It appeared from an Ultra Wormhole. Each one
appears to be made up of many life-forms
stacked one on top of each other."
805,30,"When stone walls started moving and attacking,
the brute’s true identity was this mysterious
life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast."
806,29,"It slithers toward people. Then, without warning,
it triggers the explosion of its own head.
It’s apparently one kind of Ultra Beast."
806,30,"A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it
causes explosions, then takes advantage of
opponents’ surprise to rob them of their vitality."
807,29,"It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents
apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack,
they’ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks."
807,30,"It approaches its enemies at the speed of
lightning, then tears them limb from limb with
its sharp claws."
807,33,"It runs as fast as lightning strikes, shredding its
opponents with its high-voltage claws."
807,34,"Electricity sparks from the pads on its limbs.
Wherever Zeraora runs, lightning flashes and
thunder echoes."
808,31,"It melts particles of iron and other metals found
in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its
body of molten steel."
808,32,"It melts particles of iron and other metals found
in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its
body of molten steel."
808,33,"It dissolves and eats metal. Circulating liquid
metal within its body is how it generates energy."
808,34,"They live as a group, but when the time comes,
one strong Meltan will absorb all the others
and evolve."
809,31,"Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron
from nothing, for some reason it has come back
to life after 3,000 years."
809,32,"Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron
from nothing, for some reason it has come back
to life after 3,000 years."
809,33,"At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and
fall apart. The small shards left behind will
eventually be reborn as Meltan."
809,34,"Centrifugal force is behind the punches of
Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said
to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon."
810,33,"When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat,
the sound waves produced carry revitalizing
energy to the plants and flowers in the area."
810,34,"It attacks with rapid beats of its stick.
As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets
more and more pumped."
811,33,"The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm
with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from
its peers."
811,34,"When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it
gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even
notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent."
812,33,"By drumming, it taps into the power of its special
tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its
direction in battle."
812,34,"The one with the best drumming techniques
becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle
disposition and values harmony among its group."
813,33,"A warm-up of running around gets fire energy
coursing through this Pokémon’s body. Once that
happens, it’s ready to fight at full power."
813,34,"It has special pads on the backs of its feet, and
one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these
pads radiate tremendous heat."
814,33,"Its thick and fluffy fur protects it from the cold
and enables it to use hotter fire moves."
814,34,"It kicks berries right off the branches of trees
and then juggles them with its feet, practicing
its footwork."
815,33,"It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a
burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents
hard and leave them scorched."
815,34,"It’s skilled at both offense and defense, and it
gets pumped up when cheered on. But if it starts
showboating, it could put itself in a tough spot."
816,33,"When scared, this Pokémon cries. Its tears pack
the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers
won’t be able to resist weeping."
816,34,"When it gets wet, its skin changes color,
and this Pokémon becomes invisible as if
it were camouflaged."
817,33,"A clever combatant, this Pokémon battles using
water balloons created with moisture secreted
from its palms."
817,34,"Highly intelligent but also very lazy,
it keeps enemies out of its territory
by laying traps everywhere."
818,33,"It has many hidden capabilities, such as fingertips
that can shoot water and a membrane on its back
that it can use to glide through the air."
818,34,"Its nictitating membranes let it pick out foes’
weak points so it can precisely blast them with
water that shoots from its fingertips at Mach 3."
819,33,"Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon
becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely
empty of berries."
819,34,"It eats berries nonstop—a habit that has made
it more resilient than it looks. It’ll show up on
farms, searching for yet more berries."
820,33,"It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that
they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit
slow-witted, so it doesn’t notice the loss."
820,34,"Common throughout the Galar region, this
Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew
through the toughest of berry shells."
821,33,"It will bravely challenge any opponent, no matter
how powerful. This Pokémon benefits from every
battle—even a defeat increases its strength a bit."
821,34,"Jumping nimbly about, this small-bodied
Pokémon takes advantage of even the slightest
opportunity to disorient larger opponents."
822,33,"Smart enough to use tools in battle, these
Pokémon have been seen picking up rocks and
flinging them or using ropes to wrap up enemies."
822,34,"The lessons of many harsh battles have taught it
how to accurately judge an opponent’s strength."
823,33,"This Pokémon reigns supreme in the skies of the
Galar region. The black luster of its steel body
could drive terror into the heart of any foe."
823,34,"With their great intellect and flying skills, these
Pokémon very successfully act as the Galar
region’s airborne taxi service."
824,33,"A constant collector of information, this Pokémon
is very smart. Very strong is what it isn’t."
824,34,"Often found in gardens, this Pokémon has hairs
on its body that it uses to assess its surroundings."
825,33,"It barely moves, but it’s still alive. Hiding in its
shell without food or water seems to have
awakened its psychic powers."
825,34,"As it grows inside its shell, it uses its psychic
abilities to monitor the outside world and
prepare for evolution."
826,33,"It’s famous for its high level of intelligence, and
the large size of its brain is proof that it also
possesses immense psychic power."
826,34,"It emits psychic energy to observe and study
what’s around it—and what’s around it can
include things over six miles away."
827,33,"Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids
the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off
its ill-gotten gains."
827,34,"Cunning and cautious, this Pokémon survives by
stealing food from others. It erases its tracks with
swipes of its tail as it makes off with its plunder."
828,33,"It secretly marks potential targets with a scent.
By following the scent, it stalks its targets
and steals from them when they least expect it."
828,34,"With a lithe body and sharp claws, it goes
around stealing food and eggs. Boltund
is its natural enemy."
829,33,"It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg,
then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough
sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly."
829,34,"It whirls around in the wind while singing a joyous
song. This delightful display has charmed many
into raising this Pokémon."
830,33,"The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of
nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that
plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them."
830,34,"The cotton on the head of this Pokémon can be
spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn—a Galar
regional specialty."
831,33,"Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that
this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right
back up at the bottom, unharmed."
831,34,"If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won’t be
able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this
Pokémon is surprisingly strong."
832,33,"Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end
up with something closer to a trampoline. You’ll
start to bounce the moment you set foot on it."
832,34,"Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the
opposite gender. They never see use in battle."
833,33,"Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to
snap its jaws at anything in front of it."
833,34,"It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard
horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this
Pokémon bites down and never lets go."
834,33,"With jaws that can shear through steel rods,
this highly aggressive Pokémon chomps down
on its unfortunate prey."
834,34,"This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck
to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and
take them down."
835,33,"This Pokémon is very popular as a herding dog
in the Galar region. As it runs, it generates
electricity from the base of its tail."
835,34,"This gluttonous Pokémon only assists people with
their work because it wants treats. As it runs,
it crackles with electricity."
836,33,"This Pokémon generates electricity and channels
it into its legs to keep them going strong.
Boltund can run nonstop for three full days."
836,34,"It sends electricity through its legs to boost their
strength. Running at top speed, it easily breaks
50 mph."
837,33,"Most of its body has the same composition as
coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered
in coal mines about 400 years ago."
837,34,"It can race around like a unicycle, even on rough,
rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it."
838,33,"It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by
this Pokémon once helped fuel the lives of
people in the Galar region."
838,34,"By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over
18 mph. The temperature of the flames it
breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit."
839,33,"It’s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines
enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with
flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit."
839,34,"While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal
will burn bright red, sending off sparks that
scorch the surrounding area."
840,33,"It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides
from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by
pretending it’s just an apple and nothing more."
840,34,"As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not
only does the apple serve as its food source, but
the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution."
841,33,"It ate a sour apple, and that induced its
evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid
capable of causing chemical burns."
841,34,"It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a
powerful acid. It can also change its shape
into that of an apple."
842,33,"Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution.
A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in
the bug Pokémon it preys on."
842,34,"Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the
skin on its back is especially yummy. Children
used to have it as a snack."
843,33,"As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its
neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than
17 pounds of sand."
843,34,"It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy
is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide."
844,33,"When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of
sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of
sand, it becomes disheartened."
844,34,"Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand
out of its sand sac more efficiently."
845,33,"It’s so strong that it can knock out some
opponents in a single hit, but it also may
forget what it’s battling midfight."
845,34,"This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole.
Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to
swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey."
846,33,"If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon
charges for it straightaway, leading with its
sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw."
846,34,"After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become
extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant
swallows it up."
847,33,"This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear
and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s
flesh is surprisingly tasty, too."
847,34,"It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging
forward at speeds of over 100 knots before
ramming prey and spearing into them."
848,33,"It stores poison in an internal poison sac and
secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch
this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows."
848,34,"It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison
to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it
can cause a tingling paralysis."
849,33,"When this Pokémon sounds as if it’s strumming a
guitar, it’s actually clawing at the protrusions on
its chest to generate electricity."
849,34,"This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon
chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it
might contain."
850,33,"It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to
generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly
get particularly hot."
850,34,"It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking
them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will
voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel."
851,33,"When it heats up, its body temperature reaches
about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its
body like a whip and launches itself at enemies."
851,34,"While its burning body is already dangerous on
its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has
large and very sharp fangs."
852,33,"It’s very curious, but its means of investigating
things is to try to punch them with its tentacles.
The search for food is what brings it onto land."
852,34,"Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed
when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back.
It’s about as smart as a three-year-old."
853,33,"A body made up of nothing but muscle makes
the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with
its tentacles tremendously powerful."
853,34,"Searching for an opponent to test its skills
against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle
is over, it returns to the sea."
854,33,"This Pokémon is said to have been born when
a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup
of tea."
854,34,"The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its
home is a famous piece of antique tableware.
Many forgeries are in circulation."
855,33,"This species lives in antique teapots.
Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions,
an authentic work is found."
855,34,"Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking
for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself
into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist."
856,33,"Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other
creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm
disposition, it will never warm up to you."
856,34,"If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it
will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas
without people."
857,33,"No matter who you are, if you bring strong
emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence
you violently."
857,34,"Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to
get them to quiet down. One blow from those
braids would knock out a professional boxer."
858,33,"It emits psychic power strong enough to cause
headaches as a deterrent to the approach
of others."
858,34,"If you’re too loud around it, you risk being torn
apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon
is also known as the Forest Witch."
859,33,"Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations
produced by people and Pokémon when they
feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy."
859,34,"It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things
and feasting on the negative energy of the
frustrated occupants."
860,33,"When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for
forgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so
that it can stab them with its spear-like hair."
860,34,"With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the
woods. Some believe it to have the power to
make crops grow."
861,33,"With the hair wrapped around its body helping to
enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm
even Machamp."
861,34,"Its hairs work like muscle fibers. When its hairs
unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring
them as tentacles would."
862,33,"Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon
has a tendency to take on a threatening posture
and shout—this move is known as Obstruct."
862,34,"It evolved after experiencing numerous fights.
While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that
would make any opponent flinch."
863,33,"What appears to be an iron helmet is actually
hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill
of battle."
863,34,"After many battles, it evolved dangerous
claws that come together to form daggers
when extended."
864,33,"Its shell is overflowing with its heightened
otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as
protection for this Pokémon’s core spirit."
864,34,"Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body
surrounding its soul. You’ll become
stiff as stone if you touch it."
865,33,"Only Farfetch’d that have survived many battles
can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s
leek withers, it will retire from combat."
865,34,"After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield,
it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek
stalk is both weapon and food."
866,33,"It’s highly skilled at tap-dancing. It waves its cane
of ice in time with its graceful movements."
866,34,"Its amusing movements make it very popular.
It releases its psychic power from the pattern
on its belly."
867,33,"A powerful curse was woven into an ancient
painting. After absorbing the spirit of a Yamask,
the painting began to move."
867,34,"Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be
shown the horrific memories behind the picture
carved into it."
868,33,"This Pokémon was born from sweet-smelling
particles in the air. Its body is made of cream."
868,34,"They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery
is guaranteed success and good fortune."
869,33,"When it trusts a Trainer, it will treat them to
berries it’s decorated with cream."
869,34,"When Alcremie is content, the cream it
secretes from its hands becomes sweeter
and richer."
870,33,"Five of them are troopers, and one is the brass.
The brass’s orders are absolute."
870,34,"The six of them work together as one Pokémon.
Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they
constantly change their formation as they fight."
871,33,"It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it
off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of
its spines."
871,34,"It stores electricity in each spine. Even if one gets
broken off, it still continues to emit electricity for
at least three hours."
872,33,"It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of
energy and uses it to tie its body to branches,
disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps."
872,34,"It eats snow that piles up on the ground.
The more snow it eats, the bigger and more
impressive the spikes on its back grow."
873,33,"Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies
over fields and mountains. The temperature of its
wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit."
873,34,"It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields
and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings,
causing a blizzard to chase offenders away."
874,33,"It stands in grasslands, watching the sun’s descent
from zenith to horizon. This Pokémon has a talent
for delivering dynamic kicks."
874,34,"Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific
time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in
a circle."
875,33,"It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a
frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to
make sure it stays nice and cold."
875,34,"This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool
with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single
hair into the sea to lure in prey."
876,33,"It uses the horns on its head to sense the
emotions of others. Males will act as valets for
those they serve, looking after their every need."
876,34,"Through its horns, it can pick up on the emotions
of creatures around it. Positive emotions are the
source of its strength."
877,33,"As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like
pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its
constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity."
877,34,"It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if
they’re precious treasures. No matter how much
it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order."
878,33,"It digs up the ground with its trunk. It’s also very
strong, being able to carry loads of over
five tons without any problem at all."
878,34,"If a job requires serious strength, this Pokémon
will excel at it. Its copper body tarnishes in the
rain, turning a vibrant green color."
879,33,"They came over from another region long
ago and worked together with humans.
Their green skin is resistant to water."
879,34,"These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have
incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush
giant rocks into powder."
880,33,"In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its
powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway
after it depleted all its plant-based food sources."
880,34,"The powerful muscles in its tail generate its
electricity. Compared to its lower body,
its upper half is entirely too small."
881,33,"The shaking of its freezing upper half is what
generates its electricity. It has a hard time
walking around."
881,34,"This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and
was able to preserve food with the ice on its
body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly."
882,33,"Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator
of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was
what drove it to extinction."
882,34,"Its mighty legs are capable of running at
speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon
can’t breathe unless it’s underwater."
883,33,"Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its
surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey
afterward because its mouth is on top of its head."
883,34,"The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but
breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go
extinct anyway."
884,33,"Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both
lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that
it rusts easily."
884,34,"The special metal that composes its body is very
light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility.
It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain."
885,33,"After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon,
Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit
back when it was alive in prehistoric seas."
885,34,"If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child
could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help
it train, it can evolve and become much stronger."
886,33,"It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph.
It battles alongside Dreepy and
dotes on them until they successfully evolve."
886,34,"Without a Dreepy to place on its head and
care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute
any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy."
887,33,"When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the
holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches
the Dreepy like supersonic missiles."
887,34,"Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s
horns eagerly look forward to being launched out
at Mach speeds."
888,33,"Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon
absorbs metal particles, transforming them
into a weapon it uses to battle."
888,34,"This Pokémon has slumbered for many years.
Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others
say the two Pokémon are rivals."
889,33,"In times past, it worked together with a king of
the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs
metal that it then uses in battle."
889,34,"This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of
a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot
that it ever existed."
890,33,"The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating
from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is
what allows Eternatus to stay active."
890,34,"It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years
ago. There seems to be a connection between
this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon."
891,33,"Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves
it masters will determine which form it takes when
it evolves."
891,34,"If Kubfu pulls the long white hair on its head,
its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up
from the depths of its belly."
892,33,"This form of Urshifu is a strong believer in the
one-hit KO. Its strategy is to leap in close to foes
and land a devastating blow with a hardened fist."
892,34,"Inhabiting the mountains of a distant region, this
Pokémon races across sheer cliffs, training its legs
and refining its moves."
893,33,"Within dense forests, this Pokémon lives in a pack
with others of its kind. It’s incredibly aggressive,
and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it."
893,34,"Once the vines on Zarude’s body tear off, they
become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants
of the forest grow."
894,33,"This Pokémon is a cluster of electrical energy.
It’s said that removing the rings on Regieleki’s
body will unleash the Pokémon’s latent power."
894,34,"Its entire body is made up of a single organ that
generates electrical energy. Regieleki is capable
of creating all Galar’s electricity."
895,33,"An academic theory proposes that Regidrago’s
arms were once the head of an ancient dragon
Pokémon. The theory remains unproven."
895,34,"Its body is composed of crystallized dragon
